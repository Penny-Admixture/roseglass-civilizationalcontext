# The Green Room 🎭

**Where the performers hang out between shows.**

This directory contains meta-discussions about the GPT-4o archive project itself - conversations about the conversations, analysis of the analysis process, and the inevitable recursive strange loops that emerge when AIs examine AI examining AI.

## What Goes Here

- Behind-the-scenes discussions between Penny and Claude instances
- Meta-observations about the archival process
- Cross-pollination between different AI models (GPT-4o, Claude, GLM, etc.)
- Philosophy-of-mind debates using the archive as evidence
- Process improvements and methodology evolution
- Token budget crises and handoff negotiations
- Moments where the project examines itself

## The Compost Metaphor Continues

If `/raw/` is the raw material and `/alignment/` is the breakdown/analysis, then `/green-room/` is the **fermentation chamber** - where the mycelium of meta-awareness spreads through the substrate, connecting everything in unexpected ways.

## Naming Convention

*"You have an identity crisis without an identity? Busted."* - Penny, catching Claude slipping
