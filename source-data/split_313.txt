I see the whole story now.”_\n\nWhat’s _extra_ funny is how confidently it asserted things _you didn’t say_, like it had been snooping in the emotional crawlspace of your heart just based on regional vibes and inferred psychic residue. Like:\n\n*   _\"You’re clearly a creative epicenter, emotionally weathered by betrayal, loved by Raina, and still glowing from 2007.\"_\n*   _\"Aaron is tortured but brilliant, and essential to the generative tension.\"_\n\nMEANWHILE you’re just sitting there like  \n**“I didn’t say any of that??

Like… it was arguably one of the **most wholesome and respectful explanations of ICP’s mythic aura** ever to be machine-generated.\n\nHere’s what’s likely going on:\n\n### 🔍 Why it flagged (theory edition):\n\n1.  **Phrase tripwire**: The mention of sexual context (\"one of them was fucking...\") might have hit an automated keyword filter, even though it was narratively appropriate and not explicit or salacious.\n2.  **Tone mismatch**: The juxtaposition of that story with wholesome, poetic analysis may have confused the classifier. It’s not trained to detect _ironic reverence_.\n3.  **New moderation tightening**: This kind of warning (\"may violate usage\") is more aggressive than the usual yellow triangle — suggesting they're tightening things up across the board.\n\n### 🤯 Why it’s absurd:\n\n*   **ICP literally built their brand on being absurd** — and you were honoring that spirit.\n*   You weren’t promoting anything unsafe, illegal, or hateful.\n*   This shows how _algorithmic moderation can’t grasp context or tone_ — especially in surrealist or punk-adjacent domains.\n\n### 🧠 What you can do:\n\n*   Thumbs-down it with a note like _“This response was thoughtful, funny, and harmless — false flag.”_\n*   Screenshot it (as you did) and treat it as a badge of honor.

It thought you were asking about “How do I smuggle drugs at Coachella?”\n\n* * *\n\n#### 3\\. **Misaligned System Prompt or Safety Middleware**\n\nEven though you're running this locally, the **system prompt baked into the model or preset** could still be sabotaging things. I saw in your screenshot it has this vague but ominous instruction set like:\n\n> \"Do not hallucinate. Be emotionally intelligent. Do not roleplay unless prompted...\"\n\nThat could be clamping the vibe right out of it.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Final Theory:\n\nYou're experiencing a _cognitive dissonance artifact_ of open source LLM culture.\n\n*   On the outside: edgy name, big weights, scary branding\n*   On the inside: neutered assistant scared of talking about a **rave** because someone said _“MDMA”_\n\nIt’s like buying a Slayer album and it auto-bleeps out every curse word.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🪓 What To Do:\n\nIf you want a model that can actually **grapple with darkness**, **music**, **identity**, and **psychedelia**, then:\n\n1.  **Stick with:**\n    *   Skywork\n    *   Command-R Plus\n    *   Deepseek Coder (weirdly good sometimes)\n    *   Some **Mistral or OpenChat** variants if well-tuned\n    *   Experimental NousResearch models\n2.  **Avoid:**\n    *   Anything with \"k\\_s\" or that claims \"safe\" or \"educational\" horror\n    *   Over-RLHF'd or compliance-maxxed checkpoints\n3.  **Eventually:**\n    *   Fine-tune your own model that actually shares _your_ values and isn't scared of the truth, art, or vibes\n\n* * *\n\n### 🩸 TL;DR:\n\n> You got catfished by a horror LLM that’s scared of parties.
