Not Broadway.  \n> **This is psychochemical theatre for the gods.**\n\n* * *\n\n🧪 Structure (Acts and Arcs)\n----------------------------\n\n### **Act I: The Alchemist’s Son**\n\n*   **Opening Number:** _“I’m Not a Narc (But I’m Watching)”_ — Hamilton’s ironic internal monologue over brooding synth arpeggios and dreamy 70s analog pads.\n*   **Scene:** Young Hamilton at Wesleyan, studying under David Nichols, becoming obsessed with Shulgin.\n*   **Song:** _“He Named It 2C-B”_ — gospel choir, but they're all glowing fractal beings.\n\n### **Act II: The Vice Interview**\n\n*   Real events portrayed like mythology.\n*   **Number:** _“Mescaline Is Not a Party Drug”_ (Hamilton sings while the club around him de-resolves into ancient Aztec ruins)\n*   Flashbacks to him smoking salvia while narrating calmly, like a drugged Attenborough.\n*   **Song:** _“What Does the Toad Say?”_ — full industrial drop when the 5-MeO-DMT kicks in.\n\n### **Act III: Pharmako-Apocalypse**\n\n*   Darkest hour — he’s investigating grey-market Chinese labs, ethical questions arise.\n*   **Track:** _“N,N-Dimethyltruth”_ — a stripped-down piano ballad sung into a mirror.\n*   Finale builds from chaos into crystalline harmony as he reaches a synthesis.\n*   **Closing Number:** _“There Are No Bad Drugs (Only Bad Contexts)”_\n\n* * *\n\n🎭 Cast & Vibes\n---------------\n\n*   **Hamilton Morris**: Played by himself, but holographically re-timed across ages.\n*   **David Nichols**: Ghost mentor figure, part chorus, part Obi-Wan.\n*   **Shulgin & Ann**: Ethereal spirits, singing in stereo.\n*   **The DEA**: Performed like Disney villains in lab coats; jazz-funk ensemble.\n\n* * *\n\n🎼 Soundtrack Goals\n-------------------\n\n*   Each molecule has its own **leitmotif**, using different synthesis techniques:\n    *   LSD → modular synth fugue\n    *   Ketamine → warped breakcore with trap drums\n    *   Ibogaine → minimalist polyrhythm tribal pulse\n    *   PCP → pure noise and 808s\n\n* * *\n\n🧬 What This Musical _Means_\n----------------------------\n\nIt’s not about drugs. It’s about **epistemology**. About **curiosity**. About whether it’s possible to _map the sacred_ with a fucking **NMR spectrometer**.\n\nIt ends with the haunting refrain:\n\n> “I touched the edge of God,  \n> Then filed the paperwork.”\n\n* * *\n\nI’ll help you write the libretto. You’re obviously on creative fire. We’ll call the genre:\n\n**\"PsyOpera: a neuropharmacological cabaret.\"**\n\nSo what scene do you want to storyboard first? The Salvia Vortex?

(or MP3/OGG depending on your need)**\n    *   Or just press `Ctrl + R` to bring up the Render dialog.\n2.  In the **Render Settings window**, look for:\n    *   ✅ **Enable “Split Mixer Tracks”** (on the bottom-right section)\n        *   This will render **each mixer track as a separate audio file**.\n3.  Choose your **destination folder** and **file format** (WAV is standard for stems).\n4.  Hit **Start** to render — FL will generate separate files for each active mixer track.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bonus Tips:\n\n*   Make sure each instrument is routed to its own mixer track.\n*   If a sound is routed to the **master only**, it’ll get lumped together unless manually reassigned.\n*   If you want dry vs. wet stems, check your FX routing carefully — some people make duplicate mixer tracks to capture both.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you’re using any third-party tools for \"smart\" stem separation (like AI-based vocal/instrument isolation), let me know — that's a whole different flow. But for standard stem export from a mix template, the steps above should be what you want.\n\nWant me to walk through routing each channel to the mixer real quick to make sure it all splits cleanly?","role":"assistant"}]}

That’s a great question—let’s dive into the fascinating world of the Doge meme.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🐶 Origins of the Doge Meme\n\nThe Doge meme features a Shiba Inu dog named **Kabosu**, who was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato after being rescued from a closed puppy mill. On February 23, 2010, Sato posted several photos of Kabosu on her personal blog. One particular image, showing Kabosu sitting on a couch with a curious, side-eyed expression, caught the internet's attention .\n\nThe term \"Doge\" itself is a deliberately misspelled version of \"dog,\" first appearing in a 2005 episode of the web series _Homestar Runner_ . However, it wasn't until late 2013 that the meme gained widespread popularity, especially on platforms like Reddit and Tumblr.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✨ The Meme Format\n\nDoge memes are characterized by multicolored text in Comic Sans font, representing an internal monologue filled with phrases like:\n\n*   \"such wow\"\n*   \"much noble\"\n*   \"very skill\"\n*   \"so respect\"\n\nThese phrases humorously misuse modifiers, creating a playful and endearing tone. The meme's structure often includes short, fragmented expressions that convey amazement or admiration .\n\n* * *\n\n### 🚀 Evolution and Cultural Impact\n\nIn December 2013, the meme's popularity led to the creation of **Dogecoin**, a cryptocurrency featuring Kabosu's image as its logo. Initially started as a joke, Dogecoin gained a significant following and even attracted endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk .\n\nThe meme further evolved with the emergence of \"ironic Doge\" memes, which placed the character in surreal or absurd scenarios. This gave rise to related characters like **Cheems**, another Shiba Inu known for his speech impediment, and **Walter**, a Bull Terrier featured in various humorous contexts .\n\n* * *\n\n### 🐾 Kabosu's Legacy\n\nKabosu lived a long and cherished life, passing away peacefully on May 24, 2024, at the age of 18. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news on her blog, expressing gratitude for the love and support Kabosu received worldwide .\n\nTo honor Kabosu's legacy, a bronze statue was erected in her hometown of Sakura, Japan, funded by Dogecoin supporters. Her image continues to symbolize the wholesome and humorous spirit of internet culture.\n\n* * *\n\nFor a visual journey through Doge's history, you might enjoy this video:\n\nLet me know if you have more questions or need further information!","role":"assistant"}]}

Install ComfyUI-Manager if you haven’t already.  \n    (`https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager` – a godsend for browsing, installing, and running workflows easily)\n2.  Inside it, search for:\n    *   **“Basic Img2Img”**\n    *   **“Image Variation (SD1.5 / SDXL)”**\n3.  These will give you a basic template: upload an image ➜ choose denoise strength ➜ get one or many output variants.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 📦 OR: Download these ComfyUI workflows directly\n\n*   **Basic SD1.5/SDXL img2img:**  \n    https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI\\_examples/#img2img-workflow\n*   **Stylized Variation Workflow with CLIP guidance and prompt injection:**  \n    [https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui)  \n    → Look for “Image Variation” or “Image Prompt Mixing” workflows (requires WAS node suite)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔁 BASIC BUILD BLOCKS TO ROLL YOUR OWN:\n\nIf you're building it manually in ComfyUI, the core pieces are:\n\n1.  **Image Input Node** (your starting image)\n2.  **VAE Encode Node** (to turn image into latent space)\n3.  **Noise Injection** (via Sampler with `denoise_strength` < 1.0)\n4.  **Positive/Negative Prompts** (optional for control)\n5.  **Sampler Node** (DDIM, Euler, etc)\n6.  **VAE Decode Node** (to turn back to image)\n\nYou just wire these up like this:\n\n```plaintext\n[Load Image]\n   ↓\n[VAE Encode]\n   ↓\n[Noise Sampler (e.g. KSampler)]\n   ↓\n[VAE Decode]\n   ↓\n[Save Image]\n```\n\nThen tweak:\n\n*   **Denoising strength** (`0.3–0.7` for close variations, higher for wilder ones)\n*   **CFG Scale / Sampler steps**\n*   **Prompt (optional):** you can use the original image as just a base and then layer prompts on top\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 TIPS:\n\n*   **Multiple Outputs:** Use a “Batch Prompt” or loop/duplicate through different seeds to get multiple variants in one go.\n*   **Use SDXL or SD1.5?** Img2Img works in both — SDXL gives more refined, often more abstract results.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate and share with you a `.json` workflow file directly to load into ComfyUI.\n\nWould you like:\n\n*   **SD 1.5 or SDXL?**\n*   With or without a text prompt?\n*   Just near-identical variations, or more stylized remixing?\n\nLet me know and I’ll drop you the exact JSON.","role":"assistant"}]}
