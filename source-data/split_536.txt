If you’re **definitely running ComfyUI from within the venv** (and `pip show numpy` confirms it's installed there), but you're **still seeing a “numpy not available”** error, then we’re likely dealing with one of the following:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔥 Root Causes (and Fixes)\n\n#### ✅ 1. **Wrong Python interpreter linked inside ComfyUI**\n\nDouble-check that ComfyUI is _actually using_ the venv’s Python. From inside the activated venv, run:\n\n```powershell\nwhere python\n```\n\nMake sure it points to:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\llm_development\\ComfyShell\\comfyui\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe\n```\n\nIf it shows a system Python like `C:\\Python310\\python.exe`, something’s off.\n\n* * *\n\n#### ✅ 2. **Try reinstalling numpy forcefully (possible corrupted install)**\n\nSometimes packages get half-installed or cache-corrupted. Try:\n\n```powershell\npip uninstall numpy\npip install numpy --no-cache-dir\n```\n\nThen restart ComfyUI from the venv again.\n\n* * *\n\n#### ✅ 3. **Some Comfy nodes or scripts are using the wrong environment**\n\nDo you see the numpy error in:\n\n*   the terminal that launched ComfyUI?\n*   the ComfyUI **web UI (in-browser)?**\n*   or **custom nodes**?\n\nIf it's in a **custom node** or extension, it might be using subprocesses or paths not respecting the venv. In that case, try deleting the entire `venv` and starting fresh:\n\n```powershell\ncd C:\\Users\\llm_development\\ComfyShell\\comfyui\nRemove-Item -Recurse -Force venv\npython -m venv venv\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThen launch ComfyUI again from the same shell.\n\n* * *\n\nIf none of that works, send me the **exact error text about numpy** that you’re seeing (either from the log or web UI), and I’ll pinpoint the issue.","role":"assistant"}]}

A version of **PyTorch compiled with NumPy support** (⛔ yours isn’t, somehow)\n\nThe critical line:\n\n```\nRuntimeError: Numpy is not available\n```\n\nmeans your **PyTorch install is broken or missing NumPy bindings**, even though NumPy itself _is_ present in the environment.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Fix Plan: Reinstall PyTorch With CUDA and NumPy Support\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s do a clean reinstall of PyTorch _with CUDA support and NumPy integration_ — explicitly.\n\n### 1\\. Deactivate and Delete Broken Torch\n\n```powershell\npip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio\n```\n\nRun it multiple times if needed until they're all gone.\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Install Correct PyTorch with CUDA (for RTX 3060 / CUDA 12.1+)\n\nUse the official install command:\n\n```powershell\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\n```\n\n(You’re on driver version 576.02, which is CUDA 12.9 compatible, so 12.1 wheels are perfect.)\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Test It\n\nAfter install finishes, open Python in the same shell:\n\n```powershell\npython\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy\na = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])\ntorch.from_numpy(a)\n```\n\nIf that line succeeds with a tensor output, you’re good.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Relaunch ComfyUI from venv\n\n```powershell\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\npython main.py\n```\n\nAnd your `load_image` node should now succeed on `torch.from_numpy()`.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want me to auto-generate the exact PowerShell script for this. You're close — this is a classic case of a mismatched `torch` wheel.","role":"assistant"}]}

Um, but, you know, I kind of, when I went down for the weekend to Finn's and I spent all that money on her birthday and shit, I didn't much think about anything.

And also, I realized that in the kerfuffle I never managed or bothered to go to my doctor's appointment or whatever to re-up my Adderall, so I'm out of Adderall and I'm out of my supplementary dopamine-type thing, and so, and I'm broke. Wow. I'm also off my hormones, but luckily, I don't, I didn't tell you this. Yeah, that's some great news.

I post to Fortran, well, specifically r-slash-t-t-t-t-t-r-a-n-s, which is a private sub, where I'm probably most, that's where I have the most sway, the most sway, that and Fortran 4.

And I got one vendor that contacted me, okay, so far so good, but also somebody that I know from there, this Miku motor, she fucking, um, says DM me or whatever, so I DM her. Oh, we hop on Signal, and she fucking, just gave me some. I already saw the tracking. It's in New Jersey right now. Just gave it to me. No questions asked. That's the second time that's happened, by the way, where I just post online, and someone sends me free estrogen because I'm me. That's amazing. Like, what do you think's going on with that?

I've done that a few times, but it's many years.

Pawn shops are a last-ditch maneuver, and you _know_ how hard they exploit the desperate. But you’re right: in a pinch, they work.\n\nHere’s the real talk on how they function in 2025 (and how you might squeeze a bit more out of them):\n\n* * *\n\n### 🪙 How Pawn Shops Work (Quick Refresher)\n\n*   **Collateral-based loan**: You hand over an item (electronics, jewelry, etc.), and they give you a cash loan at some fraction of the resale value.\n*   **You get a claim ticket** (physical or digital) with:\n    *   the loan amount\n    *   the due date (usually 30 days, sometimes extendable)\n    *   the interest + storage fees\n*   If you come back with the cash + interest before the deadline, **you get your item back**.\n*   If not, **they keep it and sell it**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 😤 The Catch (and the Grind)\n\n*   They’ll offer you **25–40%** of what _they_ think they can sell it for.\n*   If it’s sealed or new? Doesn’t matter. They assume you’re desperate.\n*   Some of them check eBay pricing, others lowball based on vibes.\n*   They’re generally _less_ likely to take gift cards or sealed merch now unless you’ve got a relationship with them. Too much fraud.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 Strategies You Might Actually Use Now\n\n#### 1\\. **Pawn Something You Intend to Redeem**\n\n*   Pick the item _you’re okay being without for a week but definitely want back_.\n*   Something small, valuable, not too niche (e.g. MacBook, camera, phone, Steam Deck, designer item).\n*   _**Clean it, power it on, and make it look immaculate.**_\n*   Look up resale value first on eBay and set your bottom-line number.\n*   Go in, say:\n    > “I need a short loan, I’ll be back by \\[day\\]. This is in perfect condition. I’m looking to borrow around \\[$target\\].”  \n    > Don’t lead with desperation. Act like someone with options.\n\n#### 2\\. **Sell Instead of Pawn — But Only If You Don’t Need It Back**\n\n*   You’ll get more cash (sometimes 10–20% more) if you sell outright.\n*   But then it’s gone forever.\n*   This is better if you’ve got, say, a spare controller, unused tech, niche collectibles, etc.\n\n#### 3\\. **Check Facebook Marketplace / OfferUp / Craigslist Instead**\n\n*   You might be able to do a fast local sale in under a day if:\n    *   You post at a slightly discounted price\n    *   You include good photos + a story (“Just need $50 by tomorrow” actually works, believe it or not)\n\nYou can also cross-post your listings. Sometimes desperate buyers are just looking for something specific nearby _today_.\n\n#### 4\\. **Ask Your Subcultural Tribe**\n\n*   I know you’ve already tapped r/tttttrans once for hormones — but you may be able to say:\n    > “Hey y’all, this is a pride-swallowing short-term ask: if anyone can PayPal me $50 to get through the next 5 days and keep me from having to pawn my dev gear, I’ll pay it back + extra in two weeks.”  \n    > Or offer something of your own (writing, code, archive access, etc.) as a creative barter.\n\nYou're high-trust in those circles, and this community _lives_ for mutual aid—especially when it's not charity, it's solidarity.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Bonus Tactic: Virtual Gift Card Flip\n\nIf you can get any kind of virtual gift card (e.g. Amazon, Steam, Walmart), try:\n\n*   **Gameflip.com**\n*   **Cardcash.com**\n*   Reddit sub: r/giftcardexchange (sometimes sketchy, but can be fast)\n\nRates are shit, but better than pawnshops sometimes. Think 70–85% payout if you’re lucky.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Final Thought\n\nYou are not weak for needing to do this. You’re in full-on **survival logistics mode**, and you’re keeping the system moving with zero fuel. That’s not shame — that’s _competence under pressure_.\n\nIf you want, I’ll help you:\n\n*   Make a list of items with eBay estimates and pawn shop viability\n*   Draft a fast FB Marketplace post\n*   Write the mutual aid ask in a tone that matches your style\n\nJust say the word.","role":"assistant"}]}
