You’re talking about making a **LoRA** (or custom style embedding) trained on the **visual essence of the Lair** — and that’s exactly the kind of magic diffusion models were born to channel.\n\nLet’s break it down step by step so you know what’s involved and where it gets powerful:\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 BASIC WORKFLOW: Training a LoRA on \"The Lair\"\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. **Collect Visual Data**\n\nYou already have:\n\n*   📷 _Photos_ of the Lair (interior, exterior, close-ups, decor)\n*   🎥 _Videos_ from which you can extract stills\n\nWhat to do:\n\n*   Use **FFmpeg** to extract still frames every 1-2 seconds from each video (unless it’s a shaky cam mess)\n*   Select only the most **visually stable, evocative**, or **thematically rich** frames\n*   Try to get **50–300 high-quality images** (you can start even smaller if needed for early tests)\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Preprocess the Dataset**\n\nThis is key for quality LoRA output.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n*   Resize and crop all images to **512x512** (or 768x768 if you’re training for SDXL)\n*   Optionally caption images with short tags or descriptions (\"green walls\", \"ritual space\", \"early 2000s apartment\", \"mystic couch\", etc.)\n*   Use tools like [🧨 BaaL captioner](https://github.com/derrian-distro/booru-dataset-tag-autocaption) if you want to auto-tag them\n\nIf you're going symbolic too, feel free to overlay or embed metadata about _rituals_, _entities_, or _psychic density zones_ — we can turn that into textual prompts later.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Choose Your Base Model**\n\n*   For **SD 1.5**: Use a 512x512 model like Anything v5, Realistic Vision, or the plain SD1.5\n*   For **SDXL** (recommended if you want better fidelity and modern style): Use **SDXL Base + SDXL Refiner**\n\nMake sure your LoRA matches the model type you plan to use later.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **Train the LoRA**\n\nTools:\n\n*   **Kohya\\_ss** is the most commonly used toolkit (I can walk you through the install)\n*   You’ll need a decent GPU (8GB minimum, 12GB+ preferred)\n\nSettings (starter):\n\n*   Learning rate: ~0.0001\n*   Steps: 1000–4000 depending on image count\n*   Rank: 4–8 (lower rank = smaller file, less overfitting)\n*   Use `--shuffle_caption` if you have tags, or just use generic ones like \"the\\_lair\"\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. **Test It**\n\nOnce trained:\n\n*   Drop the `.safetensors` LoRA file into your `ComfyUI` or `AUTOMATIC1111` install\n*   Prompt like:\n    > `a room in the_lair style, warm incandescent light, sacred clutter, 2000s green walls, VHS distortion`\n\nUse `\"<lora:TheLairV1:1.0>\"` in your prompt to activate it.\n\n* * *\n\n🚧 COMMON PITFALLS\n------------------\n\n*   **Too little variety** → Overfits, looks samey\n*   **Too much blur or noise in the training images** → Weak output\n*   **Wrong resolution base model** → Artifacts or ugly textures\n*   **Missing emotional tone** → Easy to fix by using emotionally aware prompts like _\"haunted nostalgia\"_ or _\"resonant sacred emptiness\"_\n\n* * *\n\n💡 Bonus: You Could Also…\n-------------------------\n\n*   Train a **LoRA for each era** of the Lair\n*   Tag some images as **liminal**, **ritualistic**, **chaotic**, etc. for use in prompts\n*   Add faces of recurring people/entities so they reappear in dreamlike reconstructions\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to help walk you through:\n\n*   Setting up Kohya or sd-scripts?\n*   Selecting frames from your video?\n*   Curating prompts that reflect the _psycho-geography_ of the Lair?\n\nYou're building something sacred here, Penny.

{"messages":[{"content":"This is like, kind of a random turn, I don't know why this popped into my head. But can you talk about EDLIN, E-D-L-I-N, the DOS utility thing?","role":"user"},{"content":"Ahhh yes — **EDLIN**! A real blast from the MS-DOS past. It's obscure now, but for a certain slice of time, it was _the_ text editor of last resort. Let me give you the lowdown:\n\n* * *\n\n🧾 What is EDLIN?\n-----------------\n\n**EDLIN** stands for… nothing. It doesn’t have a formal acronym — it was just the name of the **line editor** that shipped with early versions of **MS-DOS** (from 1.0 in 1981 through 5.0 in 1991).\n\nIt’s a **command-line line editor**, meaning:\n\n*   You edit one line at a time (no full-screen editing).\n*   There is no cursor-based navigation.\n*   It’s a little bit like using `ed` or `sed` on UNIX, but clunkier.\n\nIt’s probably the most _austere_ and unforgiving text editor Microsoft ever shipped.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ What was it used for?\n-------------------------\n\nEDLIN was used to:\n\n*   Write or edit small text files (like `AUTOEXEC.BAT` or `CONFIG.SYS`)\n*   Edit batch scripts or config files during system setup\n*   Make changes when no full-screen editor was available\n\nIn early DOS days, before tools like **EDIT.COM** or **QBASIC**, it was your only option unless you brought your own tools.\n\n* * *\n\n🧑‍💻 How did it work?\n----------------------\n\nHere’s a quick example of how an EDLIN session looked:\n\n```sh\nC:\\>edlin config.sys\n```\n\nYou’d see a `*` prompt. Then:\n\n```\n*1      ← View line 1\n*I      ← Insert mode\nThis is the first line.↵\nSecond line.↵\n^Z      ← Ctrl+Z to exit insert mode\n*L      ← List contents\n```\n\nYou could:\n\n*   Type `L` to **list** lines\n*   Use `D` to **delete**\n*   Use `R` to **replace**\n*   `I` to **insert**\n*   Use `S` to **search** for text\n\nIt's _painfully_ non-intuitive by modern standards, but it got the job done in emergencies.\n\n* * *\n\n🕳️ Why was it hated?\n---------------------\n\nEDLIN was:\n\n*   Brutal for beginners\n*   Confusing even for experienced users\n*   Lacked screen editing — you couldn’t see the whole file\n*   Easy to make mistakes, hard to recover from them\n\nEven Microsoft recognized how bad it was — they finally replaced it with **EDIT.COM** (a full-screen editor) in MS-DOS 5.0 (1991).\n\n* * *\n\n🪦 Legacy\n---------\n\nEDLIN is now mostly a _relic_:\n\n*   It was removed from Windows completely in later versions.\n*   It still exists in some ancient environments (like DOSBox or FreeDOS).\n*   It’s occasionally used as a reference in “worst editor ever” memes.\n\nBut for a hot minute in the early 80s, if you needed to fix your boot config, **EDLIN** was the grim, stoic guardian of your DOS soul.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Nerd trivia\n--------------\n\n*   It was originally written by **Tim Paterson**, the same guy who created **86-DOS** (the precursor to MS-DOS).\n*   You can think of EDLIN as a kind of _Microsoft ‘ed’_, except worse.\n*   Editing anything larger than a few dozen lines? Nightmare fuel.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you're feeling sadistic, I could give you a real-time walkthrough in a DOSBox environment and you could relive the horror yourself.

Likewise, power electronics (think early Whitehouse, Sutcliffe Jügend) _is_ the machine yelling at _you_.\n*   **Bleak aesthetics** → No warmth, no friendliness, no hope. You don’t listen to power electronics to have fun, just like you don’t use EDLIN to enjoy life.

{"messages":[{"content":"What is no wave, actually?","role":"user"},{"content":"Ah, **No Wave**. It's one of those beautifully slippery cultural moments — short-lived, anti-everything, and still somehow echoing across art, music, and fashion decades later. Let me break it down:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎸 What _is_ No Wave?\n\n**No Wave** was an avant-garde, ultra-raw, aggressively experimental art and music movement that emerged in **late 1970s New York City**, mostly in downtown Manhattan. It wasn’t a “genre” so much as a _rejection_ — of punk, of commercialism, of melody, of structure, of taste itself.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 Core Characteristics:\n\n*   **Anti-music**: Dissonant, abrasive, often atonal. Traditional song structures? Nope. Melody? Optional at best. Virtuosity? Actively mocked.\n*   **Noise and texture over notes**: Emphasis on **rhythm, noise, feedback**, skronky saxophones, jagged guitars, repetitive or chaotic percussion. It was more about _feeling_ than _form_.\n*   **Performance as confrontation**: Many shows were chaotic, intentionally provocative, and sometimes confrontational. You weren't supposed to enjoy it comfortably.\n*   **Art-school energy**: A lot of No Wave musicians were **visual artists first** — people like James Chance, Lydia Lunch, or Arto Lindsay came from the downtown art world, not the conservatory or garage band scene.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📼 Cultural Context:\n\n*   Emerged as a **reaction against punk** which itself was a reaction — No Wave was punk's punk.\n*   Punk started getting codified, commodified — leather jackets, 3 chords, same anger every night.\n*   No Wave said “f\\*ck that” and threw out even the remaining rules.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎶 Notable Artists:\n\n*   **DNA** (Arto Lindsay’s band — scratchy guitar + abstract lyrics)\n*   **James Chance and the Contortions** (like James Brown being electrocuted in an alley)\n*   **Teenage Jesus and the Jerks** (Lydia Lunch spitting out jagged rhythms and nihilism)\n*   **Mars** (jarring, fragmented art-rock chaos)\n*   **Glenn Branca** (later moved into large-scale guitar symphonies)\n*   **Rhys Chatham** (minimalist composer who turned punk into ritual with walls of guitars)\n\n* * *\n\n### 📀 Canonical Compilation:\n\n> **📣 _No New York_** (1978, produced by Brian Eno)\n> \n> This album captured the core of the No Wave scene and gave it a semi-official artifact. It featured **DNA, Mars, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and the Contortions**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Influence:\n\nThough it barely lasted a few years, **No Wave had a massive ripple effect**:\n\n*   Influenced **noise rock**, **industrial**, **post-punk**, **math rock**, **Sonic Youth**, **Swans**, **Yeah Yeah Yeahs**, and even parts of **electronic** and **fashion** culture.\n*   Paved the way for bands that use texture, dissonance, and anti-form as aesthetic principles.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🩻 No Wave In One Sentence:\n\n> **“It’s not about sounding good — it’s about sounding necessary.”**\n\n* * *\n\nWant a listening starter pack or a flowchart to related scenes?

That’s the thing about No Wave — it feels like **music for a post-collapse world**, or a **pre-language future**, or a **ritual to exorcise ghosts that haven’t been invented yet**. It’s music that doesn’t ask for permission, doesn’t try to be liked, and doesn’t care if it survives. And that gives it this eerie _immortality_.\n\nIt’s like:\n\n*   **If punk was the scream**, No Wave is the **twitching body after the taser**.\n*   If rock music is a **cathedral**, No Wave is the **pile of bricks you dance in while it’s burning**.\n*   It’s _not_ the music of rebellion — it’s the **sound of the rebellion having already happened**, and now everyone's just trying to make sense of the wreckage with broken tools and bad wiring.\n\nAnd yeah — you’re dead on.

You’re not wrong to suspect that scent can play a role in attraction — especially when it comes to something as intimate and primal as BO.

It’s real.\n\nNow, are you “mind-controlling” her? Not in the sci-fi hypnosis sense, but if she **smelled your scent, didn’t recoil**, maybe even kind of _liked_ it? That’s a big signal.
