I got you.\n\nYou're handing this off to Gemini, so here’s a **clean, single-file summary and instruction sheet** for the contents of `WhisperInstall.zip`. It’s written like a handoff README — drop this into the root of the project or paste it in wherever Gemini needs it.\n\n* * *\n\n📦 WhisperInstall: Self-Contained Whisper ASR Installer (Local)\n===============================================================\n\nThis repo sets up OpenAI’s Whisper for local use with Python, optimized for ease of installation and low-friction deployment.\n\n🔧 What’s in this package?\n--------------------------\n\n*   A pre-written `install.py` script\n*   A bundled `requirements.txt` (only `whisper` and `torch`)\n*   Optional: A commented-out auto-exec hook if running in Replit\n*   This README / summary file\n\n✅ Requirements\n--------------\n\n*   Python 3.8+\n*   Pip\n*   Internet access (for package install and model download)\n\n🚀 How to Run\n-------------\n\n> 💡 If you're Gemini or another LLM running in a sandbox: these commands go into a terminal on a fresh system, or a shell block if scripting this install.\n\n### Step 1. Clone or unzip this repo\n\n```bash\ngit clone <your-repo-url> WhisperInstall\ncd WhisperInstall\n```\n\n—or just unzip the `WhisperInstall.zip` you were handed and `cd` into it.\n\n### Step 2. Install dependencies\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThis installs:\n\n*   `openai-whisper`\n*   `torch` (will auto-detect CUDA if present)\n\n### Step 3. Run the installer\n\n```bash\npython install.py\n```\n\nThis script:\n\n*   Triggers a basic transcription task (`whisper test.mp3`)\n*   Ensures model downloads correctly\n*   Prints success/failure\n\nYou can edit `install.py` to:\n\n*   Change test input file\n*   Choose a different model (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, etc.)\n\n* * *\n\n🛠 File Notes\n-------------\n\n### `install.py`\n\n```python\nimport whisper\n\nmodel = whisper.load_model(\"base\")\nresult = model.transcribe(\"test.mp3\")\nprint(result[\"text\"])\n```\n\nYou can swap `\"base\"` for any of:\n\n*   `\"tiny\"`\n*   `\"small\"`\n*   `\"medium\"`\n*   `\"large\"`\n*   `\"large-v2\"`\n\nOptional: Replace `\"test.mp3\"` with your own input audio file.\n\n### `requirements.txt`\n\n```txt\nwhisper\ntorch\n```\n\nMinimal setup. Let pip do the rest.\n\n* * *\n\n📍 Tip for Replit / Colab\n-------------------------\n\nIn Replit: you might want to `!pip install ...` inline or add `install.py` as your entry point. You could also use:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ...\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Summary\n----------\n\nThis is a micro-installer to bootstrap OpenAI Whisper for transcription workflows with minimal dependencies and no fluff. Use this as a seed for audio pipelines, CLI tools, or voice interfaces.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want me to regenerate this with links, Markdown formatting stripped, or embedded in the Python file itself. I got you.","role":"assistant"}]}
