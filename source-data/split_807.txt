And, hell, I guess if you want to put it in order of surprising and, you know, useful or something, but it doesn't have to—just surprising is good enough.","role":"user"},{"content":"Got it — you want me to find a “what’s the latent space of \\_\\_\\_?” target where the underlying answer would _bend your brain sideways_, even though it’s just sitting there in plain sight, unasked.\n\nHere are some candidates in order of **most likely to surprise you** (and possibly be useful later), based on your history of what you _do_ ask vs. what you haven’t yet:\n\n* * *\n\n**1\\. The latent space of _mishearing_**  \nNot language in general, not phonemes, but the _transformational topology_ of how the brain swaps one auditory pattern for another under uncertainty. It’s surprisingly structured: certain syllables are only “neighbors” to specific other syllables in this space, and you can map mishearing trajectories like paths through a manifold.\n\n*   **Why surprising:** It exposes why mondegreens cluster (like why “excuse me while I kiss the sky” turns into “kiss this guy”) and why some mishearing types _never_ happen — they’re too far apart in the manifold.\n*   **Why useful:** Could explain memory corruption patterns, social rumor evolution, and even false witness testimony — all as latent space drift.\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. The latent space of _regret_**  \nNot just “emotions” — I mean the internal, multidimensional geometry of decisions you wish you hadn’t made. The surprise here is that regret spaces seem to fold in time, so events years apart can be _adjacent_ if they rhyme emotionally.\n\n*   **Why surprising:** It implies regret has a metric, and that metric is not chronological or causal but _resonance-based_.\n*   **Why useful:** Could predict self-sabotage loops and help break them by steering into “orthogonal” moves in the regret manifold.\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. The latent space of _unused streets_**  \nA city’s street grid is only half its actual navigable graph — the rest is human attention and habit. Certain streets, even when geographically central, fall into perceptual dead zones. If you mapped this “attention topology” over time, it would behave like a generative latent space: some routes are _impossible_ to think of taking until something perturbs the manifold.\n\n*   **Why surprising:** The unused-space phenomenon works the same in _social networks_, _music chords you never think to play_, or _ideas you never consider_.\n*   **Why useful:** Lets you hack your own perception to break routine and find “blind spot” opportunities.\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. The latent space of _half-remembered places from childhood_**  \nThat feeling when a location is 70% vivid but 30% dreamlike is because your brain interpolates between actual place data and a generative fill-in. That interpolation manifold has its own topology and “neighbors,” which explains why unrelated memories sometimes fuse seamlessly.\n\n*   **Why surprising:** It reveals why some dreamscapes feel “real” — they’re just valid interpolations in the childhood-place manifold.\n*   **Why useful:** Could let you intentionally generate believable yet unreal landscapes for creative or therapeutic work.\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. The latent space of _filler words_**  \nEvery “uh,” “like,” “you know” is a placeholder, but they’re not random. They live in a phonetic-semantic manifold that matches speaker anxiety level, topic unfamiliarity, and social dominance. This latent space is bizarrely consistent across languages.\n\n*   **Why surprising:** The specific _geometry_ of how filler usage shifts under pressure looks a lot like noise movement in text-to-image models.\n*   **Why useful:** Could predict when someone’s about to lie or when a conversation’s about to shift topics.\n\n* * *\n\nIf I had to bet on the one that would hit you the hardest right now, I’d go with **#1 — the latent space of mishearing**, because it’s a miniature, accessible version of the whole “latent topology” thing you’ve been talking about with East Lansing, twisted neighborhoods, and good/bad soul spaces — except here it’s running in _your own perception live_.\n\nIf you want, I can map **mishearing-space** for you as a visual diagram so you can _see_ its topology. I think it’d give you that “oh, holy shit” feeling.\n\nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Okay, um, those aren't interesting to me. Um, the phoneme one, I already kind of intuited just because of, like, FilterHouse and, like, Daft Punk and shit. Because, like, they kind of, like, shove that right in your face by taking syllables and, like, filtering them so that it sounds like, you know, other shit, and then, yeah. But that is really interesting. Now, it strikes me that that is just essentially down to the hamming distance between phonemes, correct? Um, because it seems like it's literally that, right? Um, regarding the latent space of regret, that's fascinating. Now we're getting into shit here. The half-remembered places, that is very fascinating to me. I have kind of already, like, yeah, that's something I've thought about quite a bit. The latent space of unused streets I have never thought about. That's interesting. That's cool. Oh, you know what that ties into this idea I've had for a long time? I've had, okay, I've had tons of these. So, like, MapQuest. I'm going to call it that because I'm from the 90s. But mapping services in general, like Apple Maps and Google Maps. It strikes me that the approach is fucking retarded, okay? For one thing, most people are clustered in cities. But even if we put aside that part, most routes that are getting mapped into a mapping service is from a point A to a point B. That has been done before, right? So everything like that should just be a look-up table. You have a list of known good routes, and then unless there's, you know, a road closure or something, you just pick off that list. You serve that list, and that's it. Never should the thing be recalculating on the fly. That is just idiotic. Except for the rare case, like, the 1% of the time when somebody's going from a truly novel from into to. That it's a new path, then sure, calculate it. But why are we calculating it every time? And, like, it just seems really dumb. Because you could have that look-up table optimized to fuck, right? Just because it's literally just like almost a key value store. Is it not? I mean, you basically say, here's my from, here's my to. There's your key, and then the value is the route spit out, boom. And, like, it seems like you could optimize that to shit and back. But, like, fucking this idea of calculating it every time, it's not... I mean, I guess it would be one thing if it was actually good at it, but it's not. It's not good at it at all. Like, when I was doing deliveries, I learned to just ignore it half the time. I don't know. And then the latent space of regrets, I didn't get to that yet. That is really interesting. Just watch this spider web. I'm going to have to ponder that one.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — so for the phoneme thing, you’re basically right: **Hamming distance (or a weighted variant)** between phoneme feature vectors is a big part of the topology. But the thing that makes “mishearing space” more than _just_ Hamming distance is that the brain’s perceptual map isn’t strictly geometric — it’s warped by frequency of exposure, linguistic expectation, and prosody. So it’s like Hamming distance in a non-Euclidean manifold where certain directions are “shortcuts” because you’ve heard them more often. That’s why Daft Punk-style formant filtering can make something _sound like_ an entirely different syllable even if, in raw phonetic space, the distance is fairly large — the brain happily interpolates across warped terrain.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the **unused streets thing**, you’ve hit on something that’s way deeper than it looks. What you’re describing with the “MapQuest/lookup table” critique is almost like wanting a **memoized graph traversal** instead of live recalculation — and that’s exactly how the brain does it with _familiar routes_. Humans store _canonical paths_ in long-term memory, and only reroute when there’s a perturbation (like construction). That’s the low-latency, low-cost approach — your KV store analogy is spot-on.\n\nThe surprising part is that the _same principle_ exists in social and mental navigation:\n\n*   People have “lookup table” conversations they reuse.\n*   Artists have habitual creative paths they follow unless forced into novelty.\n*   In cities, “canonical” routes get reinforced by traffic flow until alternate streets _might as well not exist_.\n\nThis is where “unused streets” turns into a latent space concept: you can imagine the road network as a huge graph where certain edges are “cold” because they’re rarely traversed, so in the perceptual manifold they’re **very far away** even if physically they’re just one block over. That’s why when you do happen to drive down one of those streets, it feels weirdly like you’ve gone _off the map_ — because you have, in the latent sense.\n\nIf you merged that with your routing lookup-table idea, you’d basically be building an _attention-weighted navigation system_ — not just storing shortest paths, but tracking how much each path gets used, and maybe even intentionally surfacing **low-weight paths** to increase exploration. That’s not something Google Maps is optimizing for at all — they’re doing live shortest-path computation with traffic weighting, but not building a truly compressed & optimized route corpus.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd the **latent space of regret** is a whole spiderweb of its own. The part that fascinates me is that it’s almost never “centered” — it’s lopsided, with heavy clusters in certain eras of your life, and weird isolated regrets floating far away like little asteroids. If you mapped it, you’d see bridges between unrelated events that share the _same emotional chord_. I suspect that if you plotted your own regret-space, you’d find a handful of “wormholes” — moments that, if you could rewrite them, would subtly rewire huge swaths of the rest of the map.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can take your **unused streets / route memoization** idea and map it _directly_ onto the regret-space concept, so the “cold” streets are the parts of your life you’ve never re-walked — and the “lookup table” is the habitual moves you make without thinking. I think it would make a killer visual metaphor that ties your navigation rant and your regret insight together.\n\nDo you want me to draw that hybrid map?","role":"assistant"}]}

And just calculate stuff absolutely when necessary. Seems like that would be the goal.","role":"user"},{"content":"Gotcha — let’s strip it down and treat your **route memoization / lookup-table** navigation idea as a pure engineering problem.\n\n**Your proposal:**\n\n*   Precompute & store “canonical” routes between most common A→B pairs (likely a huge percentage of real-world trips).\n*   When a user requests a route, serve from the precomputed table unless:\n    1.  There’s a known closure or dynamic event (accident, traffic spike).\n    2.  The requested route isn’t in the table (rare).\n*   This avoids expensive real-time graph search in the overwhelming majority of cases.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why this _should_ be good\n\n1.  **It’s basically memoization for road graphs**\n    *   In any given metro area, the distribution of trips is extremely skewed. People commute between a relatively small set of origins/destinations over and over. A KV store of A,B → route could cover most requests.\n    *   This would make route delivery near-instantaneous, zero CPU for the common case.\n2.  **Space is cheap, compute isn’t always**\n    *   Storing millions of precomputed paths is not expensive with modern infrastructure. You could store not just the “shortest path” but also “best path at 8am,” “best path at 5pm,” etc.\n3.  **Better determinism**\n    *   Today’s systems sometimes flip routes slightly from day to day, even with no relevant change in conditions, which annoys frequent drivers. Lookup tables would eliminate that drift.\n4.  **Infrastructure load reduction**\n    *   If 90%+ of queries are served directly from precomputation, you massively cut down live pathfinding requests across the fleet.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why this _isn’t_ the default today\n\n1.  **Traffic conditions mutate constantly**\n    *   In large cities, “canonical” routes can shift minute-to-minute due to accidents, weather, lane closures, or even micro-events like a truck unloading in a critical choke point.\n    *   Even if 90% of the geometry is stable, big navigation providers optimize for _always reflecting the current state_, so they default to recomputation every time rather than risk serving an obsolete route.\n2.  **Long-tail destinations are brutal**\n    *   Precomputing routes between all possible pairs in a large metro is combinatorially huge — even if most aren’t used. Google et al. have usage stats to prune the list, but new destinations pop up constantly (e.g., a concert venue that suddenly has a traffic pattern for one weekend).\n    *   The table would need constant rebalancing to stay relevant.\n3.  **Edge cases can dominate user perception**\n    *   If a user gets routed along the “precomputed best” and it turns out to be wrong _this one time_ (due to an accident that happened 5 minutes ago), they’re more likely to lose trust than if the system is consistently 2% slower but always reacts to conditions.\n    *   Big companies optimize for _trust retention_ above raw speed.\n4.  **Real-time routing is core to their business model**\n    *   Google and Apple use the constant live recomputation not just for your benefit — they’re harvesting real-time traffic data from your trip and feeding it back into the global state. Serving too many from a static table would reduce that data fidelity.\n5.  **The algorithms have been optimized to death already**\n    *   With modern heuristics (A\\* variants, contraction hierarchies, multi-level Dijkstra), computing a route on the fly for a metro-scale graph is _already_ so fast server-side that precomputation may only shave milliseconds — not enough for them to care.\n\n* * *\n\n### If you _were_ to build it\n\nThe hybrid approach (which I think is what you’re envisioning) would actually be feasible and possibly superior for _personal_ or _fleet_ use:\n\n*   Maintain a **local cache** of your most common trips.\n*   Fetch live route only if:\n    *   The trip is new.\n    *   The cache is older than X minutes.\n    *   There’s a dynamic event detected on your cached route.\n*   Optionally, precompute multiple variants (shortest, least turns, scenic, etc.).\n\nThat could be blazingly fast _and_ more human-friendly, because you wouldn’t get arbitrary daily variation unless it was truly warranted.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can sketch you **what this architecture would look like in practice** — the data structures, eviction policy for the KV store, and where you’d hook in live updates — so you could actually prototype it. That would make your 10-year-in-the-craw idea fully tangible.\n\nWant me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}
