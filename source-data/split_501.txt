Almost like the 1990s equivalent of talking to you. Like, wow, this is really real, you know? But then, at some point, towards the late 90s, Super Nintendos were in garage sales with a whole box of games. And all that for five bucks, because people, like, considered them so obsolete and worthless. But then now, it seems to be the case that not only are they collector's items, the fact that modern games aren't collectible has sort of, like, made it obvious that, you know, you know, all through GameCube or whatever is going to be the last actual collectible fucking games there is. So, yeah, then they go back to being revered a lot of times. And in general, like, with CRTs, too, there's been a cycle like that. Like, and because, you know, all the machinery to make CRTs is now gone. And, like, they're, like, obviously, like, this aesthetic reminder of a different era, and they're cool.

Record and publish the entire making-of.** Every EEPROM write cycle. Every failed CRC. That’s the art.  \n**4\\.
