And like, is it something that you just, you know, like a baseball, once it leaves your hand, it's doing what it's doing, but there's still a way to make it spin. How, how do we do that with the electron or photon or whatever the fuck it is? Um, wow, bro. Yes, I mean, yeah. Um, ooh, what's a ballistic current? I always thought ballistic is like associated with the speed of sound, or, I mean, it technically means bullet related, right? I'm curious. And you are saying topological insulators? Ooh. So, speaking of topological insulators, I've been hearing about those for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. And I still don't understand what the fuck it means. Did you tell me about that? Photoconductive antennas? Ultrafast laser pulses generate carrier motion. That's interesting. Could you talk about that? Carrier Hertz quantum cascade lasers, static semiconductor layers. Okay. So, but the static semiconductor layers, that technology is what, like specifically, and like, how does it work and why wasn't it made earlier and like what advancement allowed it to be made? Those are my questions. Metamaterials? Tell me more. Metamaterials is extremely broad, right? So, like, can you tell me specifically? CMOS compatible terahertz circuits. Okay. And how did that, like, how did that, like, how did the terahertz circuits, well, first of all, I don't, you know, complimentary, what was it? Complimentary metal oxide something, but like, so I know that that's like normal, like not exotic electronics, which is cool. And then, so what makes something CMOS compatible, eh? I mean, I can imagine, but I'm just curious the specifics. And then what types of terahertz circuits were not compatible with it? And then what changed to allow them to become compatible with it? And what were those circuits specifically? Like, you know, the actual chips they got made, I'm pretty sure. Daddy, I want a femtosecond laser. And I want a nonlinear crystal setup just because, duh. Duh. What, uh, so, like, can you describe the setup? Terahertz QCL. Nice. Pulsed. Photoconductive antenna.

{"messages":[{"content":"Oh, fuckaroo. I guess I didn't really consider the fact that solid nitrogen and liquid nitrogen are apparently not easily convertible. Dang. So, like, because I'm presuming that it just sublimates. Then my question is, like, how do you make liquid nitrogen and, like, if it's, like, an intermediate pressure regime, like, no, never mind. I just thought of an idea that was basically a bomb. Because I was like, uh, couldn't we just, like, take the dry ice, seal it up in something, then it'll melt partially?

Let's talk thermal physics with the danger dial turned to **\"just this side of felony\"** and figure out why **dry ice** feels like it _should_ be the poor man's cryo but just doesn’t quite kick as much thermal ass as **liquid nitrogen**. Here's why:\n\n* * *\n\n🧊 TL;DR: Why Dry Ice Isn’t as Good as Liquid Nitrogen for Cryo Experiments\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Dry ice is a solid**, and **it sublimates**, not melts — so it doesn’t form a continuous cooling film like a liquid does.\n*   **Thermal contact sucks**: There's usually an air gap or sublimated gas layer insulating the target.\n*   **Heat transfer rate is worse** due to poor surface contact + slower phase change efficiency.\n*   **Dry ice only gets you to -78°C (~195K)** — which **isn't cold enough** for most superconductors (e.g., YBCO needs <90K).\n*   **Liquid nitrogen is a liquid** and **boils** (not sublimates), so it **pulls heat away faster and more evenly** due to better thermal coupling.\n\n* * *\n\n💥 Why Your \"Seal Dry Ice in a Container\" Idea is Technically Valid and Also a Bomb\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou're _not wrong_ in spirit — you’re thinking in terms of **phase change energy and pressure-induced liquefaction**, which is solid physics.\n\nBut yeah, that’s also **literally how cryobombs work**. Here's why it’s a bad idea:\n\n*   Dry ice sublimates into **CO₂ gas**, and **1 mole = 22.4L at STP**, as you noted.\n*   If sealed, pressure builds **exponentially fast**, since the volume of the gas wants to be orders of magnitude bigger than the original chunk.\n*   You can’t safely contain this without a pressure relief valve or vent, or you **Kaboom** like a low-budget MythBusters episode.\n*   **Also**, to get **liquid CO₂**, you'd need to compress it above 5.1 atm and keep it below 31°C — which, yes, _is doable_, but not with a soda bottle in your garage.\n\n* * *\n\n💡 So Why Is Liquid Nitrogen So Damn Good?\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   It’s **already in liquid form** at 77K — so you don’t need any sketchy pressure rig to get there.\n*   When it **boils**, it **absorbs a fuckton of energy** via latent heat of vaporization:  \n    ~200 kJ/kg — and that phase transition **rips heat away** fast.\n*   It _flows_ around objects → **full surface contact**, **even thermal distribution**, and no awkward gaps.\n*   You can **dunk** your object fully and get a nice uniform temp drop.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Why Dry Ice Is Just… Meh for Some Stuff\n------------------------------------------\n\n### ✘ Problem: The Leidenfrost Effect of Sublimation\n\n*   Dry ice **sublimates** into a **CO₂ gas layer**, which then **insulates** the very thing you’re trying to cool.\n*   Unless it’s _pressed hard_ or thermally pasted against a surface, you get **crappy contact**.\n\n### ✔ Partial Fixes:\n\n*   Press metal to metal (e.g. copper block) with **thermal grease** and clamp the dry ice tight.\n*   You can pre-chill a **copper cold finger** or heatsink, then quickly move it to your target.\n\nStill, you **won’t hit anywhere near LN₂ levels of performance**, and you **definitely won’t reach 90K**, so no YBCO magic.\n\n* * *\n\n🔬 What _Is_ Dry Ice Good For?\n------------------------------\n\n*   Quick chilling (not cryogenic): CPUs, fog machines, freezing pests, etc.\n*   Cool-looking science demos: Bubbles, cloud chambers, lasers in mist.\n*   Makes decent temporary cooling source for **+100°C to -78°C** range.\n*   Dry ice in **alcohol baths** (e.g. isopropanol) gives **better thermal contact** — can hit ~ -78°C evenly.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ If You're Feeling Mad Scientist\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you _do_ want to experiment more safely with **compressing and liquefying gases**:\n\n*   Look up **Joule-Thomson expansion** + **adiabatic cooling** principles\n*   Or build a **cascade cooling loop** using refrigerants (complex, pricey, risky)\n*   Or hack an old **dewar** with LN₂ refills (ask local welding shops or college labs)\n\nBut dry ice alone?

You sniffed out the dream of **cryogenic perpetual motion**, and you're right to call it out as a mirage. Here’s why:\n\n*   **Liquid nitrogen is colder than liquid air** (77K vs ~80–90K).\n*   You can’t use **liquid air** to condense more _air_ — it doesn’t have the thermodynamic delta-T to cross the phase change threshold.\n*   Any heat you absorb while condensing air causes your LN₂ to **boil off** faster than you can get usable liquid back.\n\nSo while you can **trap some LOX** or **condense air** with LN₂, you are _spending_ cold irreversibly.

{"messages":[{"content":"actually should i not even be using the windows installer and just doing like teh git thing you had me convert all custom nodes to so that it has the git files and can do proper updates and etc??  can that be done for comfy as a whole too and should i just be doing that?  idk like i KNOW we have done the old python thing before but it was on commandline idk how to do it w a gui installer??","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes — 1000x yes — **you absolutely should switch to installing ComfyUI via Git instead of the Windows installer.** The GUI installer is convenient _but brittle as hell_, especially for power users like you who use custom nodes, update often, and want control over your environment.\n\n### ✅ Why Git-based installs are better (especially for you):\n\n| Feature | Windows Installer | Git-based Install |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Custom node compatibility | ❌ often breaks | ✅ flexible + easy to debug |\n| Sentencepiece/Python bugs | ❌ common & hard to fix | ✅ fixable by editing `requirements.txt` or virtualenv |\n| Version control | ❌ no rollback | ✅ `git checkout` any version you want |\n| Updating | ❌ \"black box\" | ✅ `git pull` updates everything cleanly |\n| Debugging | ❌ no control | ✅ full control over env, logs, modules |\n| Modding ComfyUI itself | ❌ very hard | ✅ easy—it's just Python files |\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ Here’s how to install ComfyUI _the correct way_ (Git method):\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. ✅ Install Python 3.10.11 manually\n\n*   Download: [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe)\n*   During install:\n    *   ✅ Check **Add Python to PATH**\n    *   ✅ Choose **Customize Installation**\n    *   ✅ Enable `pip`, `venv`, etc.\n    *   ✅ Install for _all users_ or at a clean path like `C:\\Python310`\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. ✅ Clone ComfyUI using Git\n\n```bash\ncd C:\\Users\\llm_development\\Documents\ngit clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git\ncd ComfyUI\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. ✅ Create virtual environment (in PowerShell)\n\n```powershell\npython -m venv venv\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n> If `sentencepiece==0.2.0` fails, open `requirements.txt` and downgrade to `sentencepiece==0.1.99`, then re-run:\n\n```powershell\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. ✅ Run it\n\n```powershell\npython main.py\n```\n\n> You’ll see the ComfyUI server open at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`\n\n* * *\n\n🌱 Optional: Link your custom nodes with Git too\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Inside `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`, clone your favorite custom nodes like:\n\n```bash\ncd custom_nodes\ngit clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux.git\n```\n\nThis makes updating them as easy as:\n\n```bash\ncd ComfyUI\ngit pull\ncd custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager\ngit pull\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🌀 TL;DR for you:\n-----------------\n\n> **Yes, switch to Git.** It’s the only reliable setup for what you're doing.  \n> Install Python 3.10.11, `git clone` ComfyUI, manually fix `requirements.txt` (if needed), and **never touch the Windows installer again**.\n\nWant me to generate you a full install script to do all of this hands-free?

{"messages":[{"content":"i believe i just installed that old python like 2 days ago can we check somehow w a command?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yup! You can absolutely check what Python versions are installed on your system using several methods.
