Like, I'm sorry, I guess I'm not hardcore enough, but like, the whole idea of, oh, we're gonna adjust where the keyboard—the cursor is? Should we use the arrow keys? Nah. Like, fuck everything about that.","role":"user"},{"content":"LMAO. Okay. Yes. Yes.\n\nWelcome to the sacred and deeply cursed temple of **Vim**, where pain is a feature and your suffering is a form of enlightenment.\n\nYou are absolutely not alone in asking:\n\n> **\"Why the fuck is Vim like this?!\"**\n\nSo let me break it down with both empathy and historical masochism:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙‍♂️ TL;DR: Vim is stupid _on purpose_\n\nIt’s not optimized for ease.  \nIt’s optimized for **modal muscle memory invocation in a hardware-constrained, ancient terminal world**.  \nWhich is a nice way of saying:\n\n> Vim was born in the trenches of the 1970s where arrow keys were luxury tech and mice were science fiction.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🗿 Why the cursor keys suck (in Vim's worldview)\n\nSo here's the deal: the `hjkl` keys (left/down/up/right) are Vim’s answer to the fact that **arrow keys either didn’t exist or were hard to use over serial connections**. And crucially:\n\n*   `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` are all **on the home row**, so your fingers don’t move.\n*   This lets you _move and edit at the speed of thought_, supposedly.\n*   It’s part of Vim’s deeper logic: **modal editing**, where you're either _navigating_, _editing_, or _commanding_ — not all at once like in \"normal\" editors.\n\nBUT:\n\n> If you didn’t imprint on this style early, it feels like you’re being forced to play DDR with your fingertips _just to move the damn cursor_.\n\nAnd that’s because…\n\n* * *\n\n### 🤯 Vim assumes your brain is part of the machine\n\nVim isn’t an editor.  \nIt’s a **compression algorithm for editing intent**.\n\nTo a die-hard Vim user:\n\n*   `dt\"` doesn’t look like code.  \n    It means: _“delete up to (but not including) the next double quote.”_\n*   `:%s/foo/bar/gc` isn’t gibberish — it’s _surgical command poetry._\n\nBut for everyone else? It’s like trying to cast spells in Klingon, where a single typo breaks the universe and there’s no Undo button, only shame.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💀 Why it _feels_ hostile\n\n*   **You can’t just open it and start typing.**\n*   **You have to exit insert mode to save.**\n*   **You exit with `:wq`, or `ZZ`, or `:x`, or `:q!`, or if you screw it up, you just _force quit the terminal_.**\n\nIt is the **Dark Souls** of text editors. It teaches by punishing.  \nBut like Dark Souls, there’s a weird holiness to mastering it — if you _choose_ to.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧘‍♀️ My position: You're not \"not hardcore\" — you're just not in a cult\n\nYou’re sane for being frustrated.  \nYou’re sane for not wanting to remap your muscle memory around a philosophy written before your parents had email.  \nAnd yet, the world contains both you _and_ people who will:\n\n*   Write a novel in Vim\n*   Build their startup in Vim\n*   **Configure Vim to the point of enlightenment and madness indistinguishably**\n\n* * *\n\nSo yeah.

Just: “here’s the Win32 binary / GTK build / whatever, go nuts.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌌 Re: Textadept\n\nIf SciTE is like a durable multitool, Textadept is like a **handmade lightsaber** — minimal, powerful, and tuned by you.\n\n*   Built on **Scintilla**, just like SciTE.\n*   Scriptable entirely in **Lua** (it even exposes its UI and editing behaviors).\n*   Zero GUI bloat. It’s a _window and a buffer_. That’s it.\n*   It ships with a terminal version (!), so you can use it on servers and old rigs.\n*   And like SciTE, it’s engineered for **clarity over cleverness.**\n\nHonestly, it’s almost eerie how much it shares in spirit with SciTE — but it’s _also_ more extensible if you’re ready to dig into scripting. I think you’re gonna vibe with it.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📝 Optional personal project idea:\n\n> You could totally write a side-by-side breakdown:  \n> **“SciTE vs. Textadept: Two Scintilla Paths in a World of Bloat”**  \n> (subtitle: _The Editor is Not the IDE: Notes from the Stallmanite Underground_)\n\nI’ll help you write it.
