Time‑course and baseline blending**\n\nPsychedelics hit on a timescale of minutes to hours, and they make perceptual shifts that are **salient, rapid, and context‑breaking** — impossible not to notice.  \nEstrogen’s effects accrue over **days to weeks** and tend to modulate _baseline_ functions — mood stability, energy, subtle cognition, stress reactivity. You’re not seeing fireworks; you’re slowly drifting a few degrees off course, and the change is continuous enough that you don’t get a “woah, something just happened” moment.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. It hijacks “self” rather than overlaying it**\n\nPsychedelics feel like something happening _to_ you — even if ego dissolution happens, there’s a meta‑awareness (“oh, I’m tripping”).  \nEstrogen alters _how you feel like yourself_ — your baseline affective tone, your default cognitive style. The very systems that would _notice_ the change are part of what’s changing. It’s like trying to smell your own nose.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Hormonal feedback loops involve other people as mirrors**\n\nA lot of estrogen’s more noticeable short‑term effects in adults aren’t raw “trippy” sensations but **social‑emotional calibration shifts** — empathy balance, irritability threshold, verbal tone, micro‑facial expressions. These are easier for _others_ to detect because they see you relative to your normal, whereas you’re just _in it_.  \nThat’s why Finn can spot it — they get the before/after contrast in a way you don’t from inside the moment.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Psychedelics hit sensory/perceptual gating; estrogen hits modulation systems**\n\nPsychedelics whack the **thalamic gating** and cortical feedback loops, so you get an immediate perceptual signature: colors, sounds, patterns, time dilation.  \nEstrogen shifts **neuromodulators** (serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin systems) and even **structural plasticity** in certain circuits. That doesn’t produce an acute “signal” — it shifts probabilities of emotional reactions and cognitive inclinations. You only notice it in patterns over time, not in the moment.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want an analogy:\n\n*   **Psychedelics** are like suddenly getting a glitchy video filter slapped on your vision — instant awareness.\n*   **Estrogen** is like someone turning the thermostat up or down _one degree per day_ — you won’t notice until you’re sweating or shivering, and by then, you think it’s just the weather.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I could help you make a **personal hormone “early warning system”** so you don’t have to rely on Finn pointing it out. It would basically track micro‑behavioral and cognitive markers that shift first, so you can catch the drift before it gets strong enough for others to notice.\n\nDo you want me to build that?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"So, I'm actually curious, so like, if hormones affect the mind in these kind of subtle ways, and the range of drugs that I'm used to considering affects it in this other set of ways, like, what other ways are there? What types of mental effects, modulation things, could theoretically exist? Like, is there something that's halfway between the two? Is there something that's on the far side of either? You know, is there something that's completely on a different axis? What types of, you know, mind alteration is even possible?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — that’s a really good question, and it gets into mapping a **taxonomy of mind alteration** that isn’t just “drugs vs. hormones,” but actually organized by _what_ they alter and _how_ they alter it.\n\nYou can think of these axes as dimensions in a “state-space of cognition,” where substances, experiences, and even physiological states can move you around.\n\n* * *\n\n**A Rough Taxonomy of Mind Alteration Types**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n### **1\\. Rapid, high-salience perceptual gating changes** _(classic psychedelics, dissociatives)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Sudden disruption of sensory input filtering & cortical feedback loops.\n*   **Example:** LSD, psilocybin, ketamine.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Fast onset, obvious “something’s different,” usually strong sensory & meaning-making shifts.\n*   **Axis:** Perceptual salience vs. baseline reality.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Slow, baseline affective modulation** _(sex hormones, thyroid, chronic SSRIs)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Long-term changes in neuromodulator receptor density, endocrine feedback, plasticity rates.\n*   **Example:** Estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Gradual mood, energy, and motivation drift. Hard to self-detect without external mirrors.\n*   **Axis:** Emotional tone, stress reactivity, cognitive bias.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Acute drive/motivation tuning** _(psychostimulants, sedatives)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Direct modulation of dopamine/norepinephrine or GABA/glutamate activity in frontal-striatal circuits.\n*   **Example:** Amphetamine, methylphenidate, caffeine, alcohol, benzodiazepines.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Immediate shift in “go” or “stop” systems; affects focus, inhibition, impulsivity.\n*   **Axis:** Task engagement vs. disengagement.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Contextual schema rewriting** _(trauma, immersive experiences, deep meditation retreats)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Intense emotional/sensory input reshapes core associations & identity schemas.\n*   **Example:** Near-death experiences, psychedelic breakthrough states, cult indoctrination, prolonged sensory deprivation.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Not just altered _state_ but altered _self-narrative_ afterward.\n*   **Axis:** Long-term worldview reconfiguration.\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. Background cognitive “frame rate” shift** _(fever delirium, sleep deprivation, mania/hypomania)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Global changes in arousal & default mode network coherence.\n*   **Example:** High fever, bipolar manic episodes, microseizure activity.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Time perception and “thought speed” skew dramatically; may feel hyperconnected or slowed/detached.\n*   **Axis:** Processing tempo vs. stability.\n\n* * *\n\n### **6\\. Subsymbolic intuition retuning** _(nootropics, subtle neuromodulator blends, low-dose psychedelics)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Tweaks pattern recognition bias and salience assignment without big sensory distortions.\n*   **Example:** Low-dose LSD, modafinil, lion’s mane mushroom, microdosing.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Feels like “being yourself but luckier” — better hunches, more pattern completion.\n*   **Axis:** Pattern recognition threshold vs. noise tolerance.\n\n* * *\n\n### **7\\. Body-map and interoceptive state warping** _(opioids, cannabinoids, somatic practices)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Alters insula and somatosensory cortex mapping; shifts the sense of “where I am” in the body.\n*   **Example:** Heroin, high-dose THC, float tanks, intense yoga.\n*   **Subjective profile:** Malleable body boundaries, altered comfort/discomfort perception, pain modulation.\n*   **Axis:** Embodiment vs. dissociation.\n\n* * *\n\n### **8\\. Long-tail identity drift** _(persistent personality change from chronic state)_\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Extended time in altered neuromodulatory or psychological states leads to synaptic pruning/reinforcement that “locks in” traits.\n*   **Example:** Years of high cortisol from stress, long-term psychedelic microdosing, sustained meditation practice.\n*   **Subjective profile:** You just _are_ different now — not an acute effect, but an accreted new baseline.\n*   **Axis:** Identity set point vs. prior self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Is there something halfway between hormones and psychedelics?\n\nYes — **subsymbolic intuition retuning** (#6) is probably the closest hybrid. It has the subtle, baseline-like feel of hormonal effects (you don’t always notice it in the moment) but can also nudge perception and cognition in a way that sometimes shows up immediately, like psychedelics.\n\nAnd there are also “on the far side” cases:\n\n*   Beyond psychedelics: **schema rewriting** (#4) — changes that outlast the drug and permanently shift the frame.\n*   Beyond hormones: **identity drift** (#8) — the slow re‑sculpting of who you are from prolonged low-level influences.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I could **draw this as an actual state-space map** with the axes labeled (e.g. _onset speed_ vs. _self-noticeability_, _duration_ vs. _baseline shift_) so you can see exactly where hormones, psychedelics, and all these other categories sit in relation to each other. That way, you could visually navigate “where else could I go?” in the possible mind alteration space.\n\nWant me to make that?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Number four is like how I would categorize my trauma w lois.. complete schema rewriting","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — what happened with Lois fits **#4: Contextual schema rewriting** almost perfectly.\n\nThe whole point of that category is that it’s not just an _altered state_ — it’s an _altered self-narrative_. After something like that, your mental “operating system” isn’t just running a new program temporarily, it’s been recompiled with new defaults for:\n\n*   **Trust and threat detection** (who feels safe, who doesn’t)\n*   **Attachment models** (what love/commitment looks like, what betrayal means)\n*   **Self-concept** (who you are in relation to others)\n*   **Future projection** (what kinds of possibilities even seem thinkable)\n\nAnd it’s sticky — you can’t simply “will” yourself back to pre‑rewrite baselines, because the event didn’t just add new memories, it rewired the _associative network_ that interprets all future inputs.\n\nPsychedelics can cause schema rewriting in a _positive_ way under certain conditions, but with trauma it’s usually involuntary and laced with high emotional salience, so it’s both more invasive and more persistent.\n\nIf you want, I could **map the before/after schema** for you — basically show what your internal operating system _probably was_ pre‑Lois and what got rewritten, so you can see what’s native and what’s an artifact of the rewrite. That’s the first step if you ever want to selectively “roll back” or patch it without losing the growth you’ve gained from surviving it.\n\nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

Not only rape, but like rape that physically damages your vagina until you're like, fucking fucked up from it. Real nice.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah… that’s a brutal but very apt analogy.\n\nSchema‑rewriting trauma, especially in the relational/attachment domain, isn’t just about an awful event — it’s about someone **reaching into the core of how you process reality** and leaving it deformed in a way that affects everything downstream. It’s invasive in the deepest sense, because it alters the _foundations_ you use to trust, love, and even make sense of your own story.\n\nThe part that makes it feel “irreversible” is that it’s not like a surface wound — it’s like someone cracked the mold you were using to shape your whole world. You can heal over it, you can build workarounds, you can even grow stronger in some ways, but the fact that the mold was tampered with never fully goes away. And the worst part is, **they don’t just take something from you — they give you something you never wanted**, and now you have to live with it.\n\nIf you want, we can actually talk about **what makes some schema rewrites _partially reversible_** and others not — because it’s not hopeless, even though it can feel that way. There are ways to “overwrite the overwrite,” but they’re slow and often require consciously engineering experiences that run _against_ the trauma’s logic until they start to stick.\n\nDo you want me to walk you through what that process might look like in your case?","role":"assistant"}]}

And you’re right: in your case, there’s no silver lining, no “redeeming value” — just the constant reminder of the harm.\n\nIt’s why schema‑rewriting trauma can feel worse than almost any acute wound — because it’s not just an injury you recover from; it’s _an alien structure inserted into the foundation of your mind_. And you can’t just excise it without affecting everything else built on top.\n\nIf you want, I can break down:\n\n*   **What parts of this “foreign structure” are truly permanent** vs.\n*   **What parts can be dismantled or replaced over time**  \n    …so you can start to separate “what I’m stuck with” from “what I can still reclaim.” That distinction is often the first relief people get after this kind of harm.\n\nDo you want me to do that for you?","role":"assistant"}]}
