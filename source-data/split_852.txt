Combine them first, then send a single file (recommended!)**\n\n*   Use a free app like **\"iLovePDF\"**, **\"Adobe Scan\"**, or **\"TinyScanner\"** to turn your screenshots into one single PDF.\n*   Saves time _and_ printing is way faster/cheaper.\n*   Then **email the PDF** to the store or upload it online.\n*   ✅ Best for 85+ pages.\n\n* * *\n\n#### ✉️ **2\\. Send them one by one (possible, but slower)**\n\n*   You _can_ email them individually, but:\n    *   They might charge **per file** or **per setup** if you ask staff to print them.\n    *   If you're doing it via **self-service**, you’ll need to batch them into a PDF or bring a USB anyway.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Your Move:\n\nIf you’ve got 5–10 minutes before heading out:\n\n1.  Use your phone to batch the images into a PDF.\n2.  Email or upload that PDF.\n3.  Walk in and print like a boss.\n\nIf not, just go and the staff _can_ help you do it from your phone, but they might be slower or charge a tiny bit more.\n\n* * *\n\nYou got this.

And so I pulled the classic penny move, and I started just bawling my eyes out in the Kinkos, and then they figured out how to do it. So they're doing it right now. I'm just running home to fucking change my shirt, and I'm heading back to pick up the paper, and I'm going to drop it off to talk to Reyna.

Just kind of, like, interview Finn about myself. You'll see. You'll see. It's interesting. But it's kind of a page-turner. I was just happy with how it turned out, and, like, I basically... I read it to make myself feel better sometimes, but it paints an interesting picture of me, anyway. All right, dude. I was just watching the, like, crazy... It's fucking so good. It's gonna overkill vision. Oh, yeah. It's kind of mesmerizing. It's very mesmerizing. What's mesmerizing? Mesmerizing. Mesmerizing. For sure. That was, like, an old thing in the 90s.

Really? Have you never seen that? No. Like, by the dryer and stuff. They're all, like... Like, youth pictures. What did it look like? No youth. Like, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I know that style of, like... That was, like... Do you want to know where my senior pictures were? Where? There's, like, this... There's this place called Whipple's Photo that's kind of, like, behind where the fitness center is now. And there's this, like, Boston Alley behind it. And it was me wearing, like, my 90s... Sorry, like, a flannel over this Nike t-shirt. It was so funny. And then it was in grayscale. That's kind of cool, though. I mean... I was in Grand Rapids, but I don't mind pictures. Grand Rapids?

Are you taking that Saturday? Oh, shit. Okay. Did you find anybody else yet? Jen said she'll let me know today, but can you take it if Jen can't? If she can't, then I can. Okay. But I did ask Jen if she could... Okay. I hope she does, because I do want to... I'm thinking about going on a date Saturday. Because, like... You don't have to at all. I don't know. Like, the thing is, like... I guess part of what I was trying to express the other day is, like, I just don't have the heart to start over from scratch with somebody again. Right? You know what I'm saying? Like, the whole thing of, like, starting from ground zero, and, like... You can think about how, like, complicated I am.
