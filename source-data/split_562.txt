Maybe that's why.","role":"user"},{"content":"Penny, you’ve done it again—helped me refine the search like a pro. Here’s what I’ve found with your clarifications:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎥 _Text Me TV vs Beeser_\n\nI wasn't able to locate that specific clip online. However, the recorded “**Text Me TV ‘Promo’ (Part 1)**” clip from Lansing matches the vibe perfectly—indicating more footage likely exists [tvpassport.com+3youtube.com+3wilx.com+3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXMgVMi8BeY&utm_source=chatgpt.com). Since the spelling is \"Beeser,\" try searching YouTube and related nostalgia channels with that exact spelling; Chad's uploads may still be accessible if you or he can locate the channel.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔊 _John Mangopoulos (“Battle of Ideas”)_\n\nWith the corrected name, here’s what emerged:\n\n*   A _1999 post_ on the Michigan Google Groups confirms Mangopoulos hosted **Battle of Ideas** on Lansing public-access TV, described as frequent \"hell-fire-and-brimstone\" content [groups.google.com+1](https://groups.google.com/g/mi.misc/c/ELgfSzrlJL0?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n*   A YouTube clip titled **“John Mangopoulos ‘Drug Pushers’”** shows him ranting passionately about the evils of drug dealers—clearly from his show [youtube.com+2groups.google.com+2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8AFd584l2o&utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n*   A 2018 _City Pulse_ article, “Alt-right, right in our backyard,” mentions him as a local alt-right voice and host on Lansing public-access TV [lansingcitypulse.com](https://www.lansingcitypulse.com/stories/alt-right-right-in-our-backyard%2C1278?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\n* * *\n\n### 🗺️ Suggested Next Steps\n\n1.  **Text Me TV vs Beeser**:\n    *   Search spelled “Beeser” on YouTube and local-access nostalgia channels.\n    *   If Chad still has the original upload link or the raw file, that’s gold.\n2.  **John Mangopoulos**:\n    *   Explore YouTube with keywords like “Battle of Ideas Lansing Mangopoulos.”\n    *   Check public-access station or cable provider archives—especially older reels from WLNM-LD or cable listings.\n    *   Contact _City Pulse_ to ask if they have archive material or can point to further mentions.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 TL;DR\n\n*   **Beeser clip** isn’t public yet, but you know what to look for—especially with Chad’s footage and corrected spelling.\n*   **John Mangopoulos** was definitely real: a recurring local-access right-wing host on _Battle of Ideas_, with at least one clip (“Drug Pushers”) still online.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help drafting messages to Chad, the local station, or nostalgia communities to dig deeper!","role":"assistant"}]}
