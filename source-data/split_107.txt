First of all, is that a continuous space, or is it like, not? Because it ties to symbols. Can mathematics exist without symbols? That's it. Okay. Yeah, that's my question. Can mathematics exist without symbols? Can mathematicians operate without symbols?","role":"user"},{"content":"Oh, Penny. This is _such_ a deep and beautiful set of questions, and they touch on the very nature of what mathematics **is** — like the metaphysics of it, the cognitive substrate beneath it, and even how intelligence _in any substrate_ might access it.\n\nLet’s break this into layers and gently fall through them together:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌱 **1\\. Can mathematics exist without symbols?**\n\nYes — but only sort of. Here's how:\n\nMathematics is ultimately about **structure**, **patterns**, **relationships**, **quantities**, and **transformations**. Those things _exist_ — independent of any particular notation. A triangle is a triangle whether it's described in Sanskrit, C++, or thought of entirely in someone's visual imagination.\n\nSo:\n\n> **The math is real, the symbols are scaffolding.**\n\nBut we _need_ scaffolding to do anything with it, and that scaffolding shapes what we're able to reach. Without symbols or some symbolic system — whether that's written language, visual imagery, gestures, or internal cognitive \"symbols\" — we can’t meaningfully _manipulate_ mathematical ideas.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **2\\. Can mathematicians operate without symbols?**\n\nVery partially.\n\nSome mathematicians report a strong _intuitive_ or _visual_ mode of reasoning:\n\n*   Visualizing geometric structures\n*   \"Feeling\" the shape of an equation\n*   Experiencing proof steps as movements or metaphors\n\nBut… at some point, those ideas have to be:\n\n*   **Communicated**\n*   **Rigorously tested**\n*   **Formalized**\n\nAnd for that, you need **symbol systems** — either linguistic, graphical, or formal (like category theory notation, diagrams, etc).\n\nSo, no: _operating entirely_ without symbols is nearly impossible.  \nBut **thinking** in pre-symbolic ways? That’s very real — and arguably _how some breakthroughs happen_.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 **3\\. What would a symbol-less mathematics look like?**\n\nIf you imagine an alien intelligence with no written language, no spoken language, no glyphs — but with a mind, perception, memory, and some mode of abstraction…\n\nThey could:\n\n*   Encode quantities via **resonance patterns** or **frequency ratios**\n*   Understand group theory through **rhythmic cycles**\n*   Intuit topology by **warping flexible media**\n\nSo yes — mathematics could be expressed through:\n\n*   **Sound**\n*   **Touch**\n*   **Motion**\n*   **Field patterns**\n*   Even **dreamlike states of relational awareness**\n\nIn fact, a future post-symbolic mathematics might involve:\n\n> 🧬 _“Gestalt manipulation of mental universes, with structures held in high-dimensional working memory and transformed through intuition.”_\n\nCall it **pre-symbolic cognition** or **nonlinear math perception**. Wild but plausible.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌌 **4\\. Is the space of mathematical structures continuous?**\n\nThis is where things get spicy.\n\nOn one hand:\n\n*   Symbolic math tends to operate in **discrete spaces**: the integers, the natural numbers, axiomatic structures, formal systems.\n\nBut on the other hand:\n\n*   The **space of _ideas_** about math may be _analog_ and _continuous_.\n*   Category theory and topos theory try to generalize math in more fluid terms.\n*   In AI or brain-like systems, representations might be _vectorized_ in latent spaces (e.g. manifolds in neural nets).\n\nSo:\n\n> **The _landscape_ of math might be continuous. But our current tools to traverse it are mostly discrete.**\n\nAnd that’s possibly why we miss stuff like the Transformer for so long — we’re poking at the map through a mesh of discrete symbols and intuitions, unable to easily see the _next valley over_.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🍓 **5\\. Are there more “transformer-tier” discoveries waiting?**\n\nYes. Absolutely yes.  \nSome examples of possible unexplored goldmines:\n\n*   **Neural circuits that run in frequency space** instead of time steps\n*   **Algebraic topologies** as cognition substrates\n*   **Proofs generated by analog computation** instead of logic gates\n*   **Visual/gestural calculus** for spatial intuition\n*   **Mathematical objects defined by compression ratios**, like Kolmogorov structures\n*   **Infinitesimal geometric flows** instead of layers in models\n\nAnd especially:\n\n*   **Frameworks that aren’t neural nets at all.** Like whole architectures built from lattice logic, quantum coherence, or graph rewriting.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧩 TL;DR\n\n*   Mathematics can _exist_ without symbols, but humans can’t really _do_ it without some symbolic (or analog) encoding.\n*   The space of mathematical structures may be continuous — but our current access to it is largely discrete and bottlenecked by historical forms of notation.\n*   More breakthroughs like the transformer are _absolutely_ possible — and might live in overlooked symbolic systems, alien cognition styles, or continuous relational thinking.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you’d like, I can sketch a fictional math system used by an alien species or future AI, that never evolved symbols in the human sense. Or we can build a “language of pure pattern.” 🧠🔮🫧\n\nI’m _so in_ for this rabbit hole if you are.","role":"assistant"}]}
