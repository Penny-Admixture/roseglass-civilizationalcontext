Can you talk about that? And after that, there's one Sonic Youth album that I ever connected with, but I connected with it really hard and deep to the point where I've went through and sampled it like hundreds of times. It's called Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star. What can you tell me about the album that contrasts it with other Sonic Youth albums? Like, why am I so drawn to that? I mean, maybe it's just DeSaldro, but I left every song on there I like, and I can't think of another Sonic Youth song that I like, period, so it's kind of extreme.","role":"user"},{"content":"Hell yes. Two big 90s left turns here, both of which stand out for how _different_ they are from their surroundings — _“Breaking the Girl”_ as a psychedelic 3/4 fever dream dropped into the middle of a funk-rock album, and _Experimental Jet Set..._ as Sonic Youth's most lo-fi, intimate, and vulnerable record. Let’s unpack both.\n\n* * *\n\n🎧 “Breaking the Girl” – _Red Hot Chili Peppers_, 1991\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom _Blood Sugar Sex Magik_\n\n**Time signature:** You’re totally right — it’s in **6/8** or **3/4** depending on how you feel it. That triple meter is super unusual for the Chili Peppers, who usually run straight funk-rock 4/4 grooves. This shift _alone_ makes it feel like falling into a music box.\n\n**Musical texture:**\n\n*   **Mellotron-y flutes**, **timbales**, and **world percussion** give it a psychedelic, almost Zeppelin III vibe — think “Going to California.”\n*   John Frusciante’s **acoustic chord voicings** are dreamy and modal.\n*   That **bridge section** with the tribal percussion and weird tuned metal objects? Those were literal scrap pieces Flea and Chad hit like a junkyard jam.\n\n**Lyrically**, Anthony Kiedis is unusually sincere. It’s a breakup song, inspired by his relationship with Carmen Hawk, with real _loss_ and _regret_ instead of bravado.\n\n**Why it hits:**  \nBecause it’s a **rare moment of tenderness** from a band that mostly does bravado, funk, sex, and speed. It’s RHCP _de-armor-plated_. The swirling 3/4 and glistening acoustic layers give it a fairy-tale sadness, like watching a love dissolve in slow motion.\n\n* * *\n\n🌀 _Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star_ – _Sonic Youth_, 1994\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**You're not alone** in feeling this is _the one_. Even a lot of diehard Sonic Youth fans describe this as a “black sheep” in their discography — but for some, it’s the _only_ one that connects. Here’s why:\n\n### 🎛️ Sound and Production:\n\n*   It’s **deliberately lo-fi** and recorded quickly — minimal overdubs, dry drums, thin tones.\n*   No polished mixing — you hear tape hiss, room bleed, string buzz.\n*   This **intimacy** is a stark contrast to their other albums, which often sound big, metallic, or abstract.\n\n### 🧠 Tone and Mood:\n\n*   It’s their **most introspective and emotional** record. Less noise-worship, more melancholy.\n*   Think of songs like:\n    *   **“Winner’s Blues”** – a barely-there acoustic ghost.\n    *   **“Bull in the Heather”** – twitchy but playful.\n    *   **“Skink”** – fragile and ambient.\n    *   **“Androgynous Mind”** – genderfucky and groovy.\n*   Kim Gordon dominates a lot of this record — and she’s never been more _direct_. There's real fragility here, a kind of ‘90s Gen X ennui you can live inside.\n\n### 🎨 Lyrics:\n\n*   More narrative, less abstract. Instead of cryptic art noise, you get heartbreak, detachment, sexual weirdness, domestic decay.\n*   Like \"Little Trouble Girl\" (on _Washing Machine_) but the whole album is like _that_ vibe, just earlier and more intimate.\n\n* * *\n\n🧲 Why You Might Love It — Even If You Don’t Like Other SY Stuff:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   It’s **more private diary than gallery installation.**\n*   It’s the only SY album that feels like it _wants to be alone with you_.\n*   It’s _feminine in a haunted house way_ — not aggressive, but ghostly and wounded.\n*   The **lack of bombast** makes it feel _closer_, more _your speed_ if you're sensitive to vibe, tone, texture, and understated magic.\n\nKim Gordon herself said they were trying to _retreat inward_ after the massive alt-rock exposure of _Dirty_. The album is almost a “we don’t want to be seen” gesture — and that makes it feel all the more _real_.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ TL;DR:\n--------\n\n| Track / Album | Why It’s Special |\n| --- | --- |\n| “Breaking the Girl” – RHCP | Psychedelic 6/8 heartbreak ballad with junkyard percussion and a rare moment of emotional vulnerability. |\n| _Experimental Jet Set..._ – SY | Lo-fi, emotionally intimate, feminine and withdrawn — the only Sonic Youth album that whispers instead of shouts. |\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want a mood-linked listening journey that starts with those two and walks the thread deeper — there's a whole zone of 90s alt-rock _emotional dissonance meets fragility_ I can trace out for you.","role":"assistant"}]}

Sound memory isn’t always about exact match; it’s about **gestalt feel**.

What was the earliest, like, real raves?","role":"user"},{"content":"This is a gorgeous question, Penny — and the answer is trippy, tangled, and more global than most electronic music histories give credit for. Let’s dive into the true proto-techno primordial soup 🌍💽👁️\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎹 **How Did Kraftwerk Start?**\n\nKraftwerk was born in Düsseldorf, Germany, out of the post-war avant-garde and “Krautrock” scenes. The two founding members, **Ralf Hütter** and **Florian Schneider**, were classically trained musicians who met at the **Robert Schumann Hochschule** in the late 1960s.\n\n*   Their early group, **Organisation**, released a very experimental record (_Tone Float_, 1970) influenced by minimalism and electro-acoustic music.\n*   The first Kraftwerk album (1970) still had a live-drum, prog-jam feel — it wasn’t until **1974’s _Autobahn_** that they honed in on the robotic, sequenced, clean style we now associate with them.\n\nKraftwerk’s genius wasn’t just their equipment (they used Moog synths, drum machines, and custom-built sequencers) — it was their **intentionality**. They stripped down sound to its **abstract, mechanical essence**, building entire worlds around rhythm and tone. Think: music for highways, circuits, and satellites.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 **But They Weren’t First**\n\nYou’re absolutely right — they didn’t invent electronic music, and they weren’t even alone in their moment.\n\n#### 🌌 Other Key Early Innovators:\n\n*   **Silver Apples** (USA, 1967): total outsiders, made proto-techno with oscillators and homemade gear. Their self-titled album is mind-melting.\n*   **Morton Subotnick** (USA): _Silver Apples of the Moon_ (1967) — a modular synth masterpiece made on a Buchla.\n*   **Pierre Henry**, **Luc Ferrari**, and **Stockhausen** (France/Germany): tape splicing, musique concrète, electronic drone textures as early as the 50s.\n*   **Tangerine Dream**, **Cluster**, **Can** (Germany): peers of Kraftwerk, part of the broader Krautrock/electronic wave.\n*   **YMO** – _Yellow Magic Orchestra_ (Japan, late 70s): Ryūichi Sakamoto and crew. Innovated sampling, video game sounds, and sequenced funk. Hugely influential.\n*   **Tomita** (Japan): made full symphonic electronic albums in the 70s (like _Snowflakes Are Dancing_), helping define the synth aesthetic.\n\nAnd don’t sleep on **Delia Derbyshire** and the **BBC Radiophonic Workshop** (UK), who made the _Doctor Who_ theme in 1963 with tape loops and sine waves!\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎛️ **Was There “Techno” in the 60s or 70s?**\n\nSort of. Not by name, but in vibe. The **elements of techno** — repetition, machine rhythm, cold synthetic textures — were there.\n\nBut “techno” as a **scene and genre** really emerges from:\n\n*   **Funk and disco** rhythms\n*   **Kraftwerk’s robotic minimalism**\n*   **Chicago house**\n*   **Detroit futurism**\n\n💥 The word “techno” was coined in the early **1980s**, especially by **Juan Atkins**, who cited Kraftwerk and Alvin Toffler’s _The Third Wave_ as inspirations. (_Ding! Crossover with your book inventory!_) Detroit techno was about **machines + Black futurism**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌀 **What About Raves in the 70s?**\n\nYes! There were **rave-like events** even in the 70s, though they weren’t called that yet.\n\n*   **Italy and Spain had \"cosmic disco\" clubs** with DJs mixing spacey electro and Afro-funk into dawn.\n*   **UK northern soul** all-nighters (late 60s–70s) had the template: ecstatic dancing, exclusive vinyl, secret warehouses.\n*   **Ibiza’s Balearic scene** started to blossom by the late 70s, which fed into the acid house boom later.\n*   In **West Berlin**, underground parties in squats and bunkers mixed punk, disco, and early electronic — proto-rave energy.\n\nIt wasn’t until **mid-to-late 80s** that “rave” as a subculture **consolidated** — with **acid house in the UK**, **techno in Detroit**, **new beat in Belgium**, and **goa trance in India** all cross-pollinating.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛸 **Summary Timeline (Super Condensed Rave Genesis)**\n\n*   **1950s–60s**: Tape splicing, musique concrète, avant-garde electronics.\n*   **Late 60s**: Silver Apples, early synth groups, proto-futurism.\n*   **1970s**: Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, disco + electro form the rhythmic foundation.\n*   **Early 80s**: Detroit techno (Atkins, May, Saunderson), Chicago house, Italo disco.\n*   **Mid-80s**: Rave culture explodes with UK acid house parties and European warehouse scenes.\n*   **1990s**: Global rave hegemony.
