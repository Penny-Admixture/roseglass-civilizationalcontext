I really do not have space.","role":"user"},{"content":"Gotcha — yeah, you’re basically in the boat of\n\n> \"I don’t love Docker, I just get dragged into it because some devs can’t be bothered to make a damn installer.\"\n\n…and you don’t want WSL’s fat `ext4.vhdx` eating half your C: drive just for that one container app.  \nSo let’s make you a **No-WSL Docker Survival Playbook** that works in your “segregation” philosophy _and_ avoids bloat.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠 **No-WSL Docker Survival Playbook**\n======================================\n\n**1\\. Your Options**\n--------------------\n\nWe’re targeting **three “escape routes”** from WSL hell:\n\n| Path | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Docker Desktop w/ Hyper-V** | Works “Windows native,” GUI included, easy for stuff that expects `docker` CLI. | Needs Windows Pro/Enterprise, slower file I/O than WSL, still eats a few GB for VM. | If you still want Docker Desktop UI + local containers. |\n| **Self-Hosted Docker in VMware/VirtualBox** | Full control, no Microsoft touching Linux, can back up/move easily, predictable space usage. | No Docker Desktop UI, you’ll manage via CLI/SSH. | Keeping Linux sealed away & running Docker “by hand.” |\n| **Remote Docker on your real Linux partition** | Zero space used on Windows, _literally_ no VM, native speed on Linux. | Must dual-boot or keep Linux running separately; remote context setup needed. | If you’re already booting into Linux sometimes. |\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. VMware / VirtualBox Path (“Segregated VM Docker”)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere’s how this works:\n\n*   You run a **minimal Linux VM** (like Alpine, Debian, or Ubuntu Server) in VMware/VirtualBox.\n*   Install Docker _inside_ it.\n*   Your Windows tools talk to that VM over the network using Docker’s remote API.\n\n### **Steps:**\n\n1.  **Make a Minimal VM**\n    *   Debian 12 or Ubuntu Server minimal (~2GB disk).\n    *   Give it ~2–4GB RAM, 2 CPUs.\n    *   Enable “Bridged Networking” so it gets an IP you can reach from Windows.\n2.  **Install Docker** (inside the VM)\n    ```bash\n    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n    ```\n3.  **Enable Remote API**  \n    Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"hosts\": [\"tcp://0.0.0.0:2375\", \"unix:///var/run/docker.sock\"]\n    }\n    ```\n    Restart Docker:\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl restart docker\n    ```\n4.  **Tell Windows to Use It**  \n    On Windows:\n    ```powershell\n    docker context create vm-docker --docker \"host=tcp://<VM-IP>:2375\"\n    docker context use vm-docker\n    ```\n    Now every `docker run …` goes to that VM instead of WSL.\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. Remote to Your Linux Partition (“Native Dual-Boot Docker”)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a Linux partition:\n\n1.  Boot into Linux, make sure Docker is installed.\n2.  Same as above: enable the remote API on Linux.\n3.  Boot back into Windows, point Docker CLI at the Linux machine’s IP (could be over LAN or via SSH tunneling).\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. Survival Tactics for WSL-Centric Docs**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nYou’re right — modern Docker docs assume WSL2 if you’re on Windows.  \n**The workaround:**\n\n*   If the docs say `docker run ...` in WSL, it’s _exactly_ the same command you’d run in your remote VM context.\n*   Any `docker-compose` stuff works the same — `docker-compose` doesn’t care if it’s local or remote, as long as the context points to the right host.\n\n**Translation Table:**\n\n| Doc says… | You do… |\n| --- | --- |\n| “Open WSL and run…” | Open a regular Windows terminal (PowerShell or CMD) with your VM Docker context set. |\n| “Install inside WSL” | Install inside your Linux VM instead. |\n| “Bind mount /mnt/c/…” | Use proper Linux paths inside the VM (`/home/user/...`). Avoid Windows paths entirely. |\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. Why This Works Long-Term**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   You can shrink or delete the VM at will.\n*   No hidden `ext4.vhdx` files on C:.\n*   Docker CLI still works exactly like everyone else’s, so you can follow AI tool install instructions without rewriting them.\n*   Your Linux and Windows worlds stay fully separated unless you choose to share something.\n\n* * *\n\n💡 If you want, I can make you a **ready-to-import VMware/VirtualBox image** with Docker pre-installed, remote API enabled, _and_ a one-line Windows context switch script so you don’t even have to remember IPs.  \nThat would give you a “press button → use Docker like the rest of the internet, no WSL” setup.\n\n* * *\n\nDo you want me to go ahead and build out that **turnkey VM image plan** for you?  \nThat way you could be using Docker from Windows without ever letting Microsoft sneak a fake Linux into C:.","role":"assistant"}]}
