You had to calculate transfer functions. Like, here's an inductor, a resistor, a capacitor, and you do, holy shit, I zero-pointed that fucking thing. Yeah, I, and I was in my third year of college, so like, I had seen some shit, but like, comp sci was kind of cushy in some ways, comparatively. Like, real world analog electronics, whoa lad.
