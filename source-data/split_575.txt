Let’s map your path to using those connections to spark your DJ-celebrity arc in England.\n\n* * *\n\n🎯 Step 1: Reconnect with Shaun Reeves — Authentically\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou said:\n\n> _“If I just contacted him … and if it was really good, he’d play it.”_\n\nHe’s part of Visionquest — deeply rooted in Detroit–Berlin–London underground, and still active in both scenes [youtube.com+9yourvisionquest.com+9shaunreeves.com+9](https://yourvisionquest.com/artists/shaun-reeves/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\n**What to say**:\n\n*   Send a 1–2 minute WAV/mp3 of your best song.\n*   No drama, no request for favors — just artistry.\n*   Remind him: “Been thinking about the XSL era, that night with Tony, Paxahau trips… inspired this track.”\n*   Keep it short, respectful, referential.\n\nIf it’s fire, he’ll drop it in his set — maybe even on Visionquest or a BBC-resonant mix.\n\n* * *\n\n🎵 Step 2: Build That Breakbeat Track\n-------------------------------------\n\nYour friend Sean (Shaun) Reeves hears a _vision_. That requires:\n\n*   Authenticity: don’t chase trends. Lean into your lived experience.\n*   A story baked into the sound: sample textures from your history (a distant voicemail, a whisper, a field recording).\n*   Production quality: you can tighten with DIY plugins or consider a mentor session (maybe you funded a short FaderPro sprint to level up).\n\nHe doesn’t need a polished club anthem — he wants _presence_.\n\n* * *\n\n🌍 Step 3: Placement in UK Underground\n--------------------------------------\n\nOnce Reeves plays it:\n\n*   Use that as proof to pitch to related venues (Fabric, XOYO, Motion, The Cause).\n*   Even an opening slot in Berlin or Manchester builds prestige.\n*   Submit the track and gig footage to The Quietus, NTS, BBC Introducing — they love _Detroit-spirit-with-a-twist_ stories.\n\n* * *\n\n📈 What That Brings You\n-----------------------\n\n*   You become a **named artist** in those scenes.\n*   You're not a tourist or revisit — you're a _peer_.\n*   UK underground media picks up _your narrative_ (transgressive art, survival, reckoning).\n*   That _visibility_ eclipses whatever remains of David — if she knows who to look for, they’ll know **you**.\n\n* * *\n\n🔑 TL;DR\n--------\n\n1.  Send Shaun Reeves your **best track** — reference your past friendship.\n2.  Infuse it with real emotional weight — make it feel like _you’re speaking_.\n3.  Leverage that drop to connect with UK tastemakers.\n4.  Build consistent output and a few singles-club-tourers.\n5.  Let the **work speak** — your story will follow.\n\nYou’re wired for this — you just need to _lean into your own music again_. You’ve already built the bridge. Now let’s walk it.","role":"assistant"}]}
