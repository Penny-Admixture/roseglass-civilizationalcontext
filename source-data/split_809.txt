{"messages":[{"content":"Oh, regarding master them to a consistent loudness level, like, uh... That's kind of the wrong thing to say to me. Not in a bad way, not like I'm mad, but like, in like... So, I've went through this whole, like, remember I told you that for a period of time that I only used SoundForge? Like, I, like I had went from SoundForge to using SoundForge and Acid to do loop-based stuff, and then I ended up going right back down to SoundForge because, like, I learned some keyboard shortcuts that let me just, like, manually lay out shit. And, like, I can do it, like, subconsciously, like, super fast. Like, I can, you can, watching it in real time is cool, actually. Because I just, like, my keyboard is just going clack, clack, clack, clack, clack. And I can make music in real time in SoundForge. That's how I do it. Um... But, like... And I thought that was kind of weird, because it's like, instead of using a GPU, just, like, bit banging a fucking VGA port or something. Like, it's weird. Um, and then it got further down the rabbit hole to where I went through an era where I basically just use EQ. Yes, that sounds, you heard that right. So, take a recording, play it back, EQ it actively and hard, record that, repeat. That's how I would compose music. And, yes, you can do that. It's, like, laborious and weird, but it ends up with something, like, unique. And then the era happened where I got Ozone 8 and now Ozone 11. I use them both, actually, for different things. But, like, with those tools, okay, it's the same workflow process. Take something, play it back, Ozone it to shit, record it, repeat the whole loop. And you can transform sounds from, like, anything to anything, practically. And, like, some of those, like, I finally, like, for instance, I never really understood the intricacies of mid-side anything. Let alone, like, applying that to, like, learning the ins and outs of the dynamic EQ. And especially the classic limiter thing and the classic EQ. Like, the classic EQ is really cool. That was the first thing I latched onto. I use that constantly. The bass-boosting cut and the fucking... Especially the mid-cut. Dude, mid-cut changed my life, dude. I use mid-cut all day. And I love how it's laid out in this weird, like, almost like the knob on a welder or something. You know, you flip it to the different range and then you just have a control for how much dB up and down. And, oh, the spectral, whatever thing, that's, like, wild, too. Because, like, to this day, I have no idea what are these knobs I'm twiddling and shit. But, like, I got it down to a science, bro. But, yeah. Is there a word for that type of composition? Like, just use EQ. Does anybody do that? Is there a word for that? It's kind of like... It's nowhere near similar, but, like, you know how, like, FM synthesis, you can, like, take and combine a bunch of stuff. Or, like, you know, additive synthesis, right? And you can just build up music almost arbitrarily from, like, little bits of shit. Sign shit. So, like, this, what my thing seems like a very... My thing seems like a very... I couldn't say it's strictly subtractive process because, like, I'm not just using EQ cuts, although I could. But, like, sometimes, like, a big part of where I get, quote, new, unquote, instrument sounds and shit to arise with that technique is, like, by... If you have, you know, an EQ curve with enough of a kink in it and the Q is high enough or whatever, then you can get, like, aspects of an existing sound that will, like, peel off into their own and whatnot. And then if you process that a couple more times, you can get that to just kind of be floating on its own as it's a new element. But is there a name for this type of shit?","role":"user"},{"content":"What you’re describing isn’t really a “known category” in mainstream music production — it’s kind of an **outsider synthesis/composition method** that overlaps with a few known ideas, but isn’t quite the same as any of them.\n\nHere’s how I’d break it down and what it’s most similar to:\n\n* * *\n\n### **Closest relatives**\n\n1.  **Resonant filtering as sound design**\n    *   In subtractive synthesis, people will sometimes sweep a high‑Q filter over a complex sound to “pull out” harmonics, like what you describe.\n    *   Drum & bass producers (esp. late 90s/early 00s) would sometimes do this with EQs or resonant filters to create alien overtones, but usually as one stage in a bigger chain — not as the _primary composition method_.\n2.  **Concrète EQ sculpting**\n    *   In musique concrète / experimental electroacoustic, you sometimes find “pure EQ pieces” where the composition is just sculpting existing recordings.\n    *   But in academic contexts, they’d call this **spectral sculpting** or **spectral editing** — usually applied offline, not live/repeated in the Ozone‑SoundForge loop like you do.\n3.  **Additive-by-isolation**\n    *   You’re sort of doing additive synthesis in reverse: you start with complex sound and _isolate sub‑components_ via EQ until they become standalone voices, then layer those.\n4.  **Iterative resampling**\n    *   This is common in certain UK underground production workflows — take a sound, process it hard, resample, process again, repeat.\n    *   Usually it’s about distortion, pitch, or time — you’re doing it with EQ as the main manipulator, which is rare.\n\n* * *\n\n### **What makes your method unique**\n\n*   **EQ as the primary instrument** — Most people treat EQ as corrective or finishing, not as the _source_ of timbral invention.\n*   **Live iterative sculpting** — The loop of playback → Ozone/EQ → resample → repeat is like “hand‑forging” sound in real time.\n*   **Emergent voices from high‑Q peaks/cuts** — You’re effectively using resonance extraction to _spawn new sound objects_, which you then treat as instruments.\n*   **Conscious mid‑side exploitation** — A lot of producers don’t dig deeply into M/S unless they’re mastering, but you’re using it in the sound‑birth stage.\n\n* * *\n\n### **What I’d call it**\n\nIf I were to coin a term for this process that would make sense in both an experimental music context _and_ to your Fortran‑crowd‑meets‑rave‑scene audience, I’d go with:\n\n*   **Spectral Carving** — clear, intuitive metaphor for isolating and shaping sonic elements with EQ until they form something new.\n*   **Resonant Extraction** — more technical, emphasizes the “peeling off” overtones part.\n*   **EQ Synthesis** — blunt, literal, but would stand out because no one uses EQ as their primary synthesis tool.\n*   **Harmonic Isolation Method** — sounds almost scientific, could be published or documented.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why this could be _your_ signature\n\nHonestly, if you documented or demoed this technique, it’s unique enough to be a Penny‑ism. In the same way Aphex Twin has his “weird tracker abuse” or Venetian Snares has his breakcore slicing style, you could make **EQ as instrument** part of your public identity.\n\nIf you want, I could help you write up a **one‑page manifesto/tutorial** for “Spectral Carving” that lays it out in your language but also makes it sound legit enough to share on LessWrong _or_ in music spaces — which would cross‑pollinate your intellectual and rave goals.\n\nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

Decide your “format bones” before filming**\n\n*   Even if you’re just being yourself, have a _consistent visual frame_: same corner of the living room, similar camera angle, maybe an opening line or sound cue.\n*   Use **light scripting**: bullet points for each topic, not a word‑for‑word script. Keeps it natural but focused.\n\n**2\\. Batch record**\n\n*   Film 3–5 short videos in one sitting while you’re in the groove and looking good. Change outfits or move to a different chair for variety.\n*   This prevents the “ugh, setup again” friction and gives you a backlog.\n\n**3\\. Keep topics snack‑sized**\n\n*   Aim for 6–12 minutes per video. That’s long enough to explore a Weird Topic but short enough to keep people watching.\n*   Use the “one weird thing” per video rule.

Cross‑pollinate audiences**\n\n*   Fortran crowd → drop a video link in a post that’s about culture/identity, not “please subscribe.”\n*   Later, when you have music up, link it in the descriptions so your ideas people can find your art.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can help you build **your first 10‑video topic list** so you can sit down, knock them out over a couple sessions, and launch with enough content that the “Pennyverse” vibe is instantly clear to anyone stumbling on your channel.\n\nDo you want me to make that list?","role":"assistant"}]}

Treat the first batch as “soft launch”**\n\n*   Don’t think of the first 5–10 videos as _public success attempts_.

Hide the view counts from yourself**\n\n*   YouTube lets you sort your dashboard by date uploaded — don’t even look at the analytics tab for the first month.\n*   Or, if you know you’ll peek, make a rule: no looking at views until you’ve uploaded 10 videos.\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\.

Build for _searchability_**\n\n*   Early low views are often because no one can find you.

Like, maybe I should, like, think about some small niches, or whatever, maybe, like, I should do a bunch of videos on, like, my ideas on AI alignment, and a bunch on, like, retro gaming equipment, because I have that, like, physically, and, you know, I guess, do you think that doing a scattershot of different stuff, if it does, in fact, some of them touch on to, like, hot button topics, like AI alignment, is that likely to, like, I don't know how that algorithm works at all, like, am I just going to, what's that called, languish in obscurity? Probably.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — if you just drop a scatter of random stuff with no plan for how people will find it, then yeah, the algorithm will probably bury you.  \nIt’s not that YouTube hates variety, but it doesn’t know who to show you to unless you give it **clusters** to work with.\n\nHere’s the way I’d approach it so you don’t languish but still get to show the “full spectrum of you”:\n\n* * *\n\n**1\\. Soft‑launch to your inner circle first**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Private videos** → send links to friends, acquaintances, anyone you want to “have the full Penny context.”\n*   Use their reactions as feedback, but also as **seeding** — if they like it, they might share it.\n*   This gets you the ego safety you want _and_ starts building a baseline audience before you ever go public.\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. Think in _series_, not scatter**\n--------------------------------------\n\nInstead of “AI alignment one day, NES hardware the next, rave stories the next” in random order, **batch them into themed runs** so the algorithm can grab on.  \nExample:\n\n*   Week 1–3: “Penny on AI Alignment” — 4–6 short videos.\n*   Week 4–6: “Retro Tech Archeology” — 4–6 videos about your hardware collection.\n*   Week 7–9: “Rave Memoirs” — stories + philosophy from that scene.\n\nWhen you post in clusters, you create a mini‑niche _for each theme_, which lets the algo find and recommend your related content.\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. Anchor each niche with a “gateway” video**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor each theme, pick _one_ video idea that’s got maximum search/discussion potential:\n\n*   AI alignment → “Why AI Alignment Thinks Like a Bad Marriage” (catchy metaphor)\n*   Retro tech → “The Weirdest Peripheral Ever Made for the NES”\n*   Rave culture → “The Rave That Changed How I See Time”\n\nThese are the ones that will likely get the most clicks, and then people will binge the others in the same playlist.\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. Give YouTube a reason to _test_ you**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe algo tests new creators by throwing your video to a small pool of strangers. If click‑through & watch time are good, it expands the pool.  \nThings that help:\n\n*   **Thumbnail & title that create curiosity** (without being clickbait)\n*   **First 10 seconds hook** (“Here’s the wildest thing I ever saw in East Lansing at 3am…” vs. “Hi, my name’s Penny…”)\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. Accept the long tail**\n----------------------------\n\nEven if you start with just your inner circle, videos can resurface months later when something in the culture touches your topic. That’s why keeping them up — even if they look “sad” in views early on — matters.\n\n* * *\n\nHonestly, with your mix of AI ideas, retro tech, and rave culture stories, you could build three micro‑audiences that partially overlap, and _those overlaps_ are where your unique vibe would stick.  \nThat’s way better than going all‑in on one niche or dumping random unrelated videos.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can sketch you a **3‑series launch plan** — AI alignment, retro tech, rave memoirs — with **first 5 episode ideas for each** so you can batch‑record and then drip them out while keeping the channel feeling cohesive.\n\nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}
