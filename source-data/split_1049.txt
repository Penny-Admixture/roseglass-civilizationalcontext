One of the inputs will show as unconnected or red.\n2.  Re-connect it manually to the correct node in the parent graph.\n3.

Here’s what’s happening:\n\n### What’s Wrong\n\n*   The **Flux Kontext Image Edit** group node you dropped in is referencing an **input node (ID 6)** that doesn’t exist in your current graph anymore.\n*   That “ghost input” is why you see the repeated error: every time ComfyUI tries to resolve it, it fails.\n*   This usually happens if:\n    1.  The workflow JSON was exported from a different version of the custom node pack (Flux/Comfyroll/etc.).\n    2.  You deleted or replaced a node that was previously wired into that slot.\n    3.  You don’t have the exact same custom node definitions as the author of the workflow.\n\n### How to Fix\n\n1.  **Expand the group node**\n    *   Double-click the **Flux Kontext Image Edit** node (the purple one).\n    *   Look for any internal child nodes showing a red input or dangling connection. That’s where “input 6” used to be.\n2.  **Rewire the missing input**\n    *   Find the spot inside the group that expects an input (likely an `IMAGE` or `LATENT`).\n    *   Reconnect it manually to the correct source node outside the group (probably your `Load Image` or `VAE Encode`).\n3.  **Check custom node versions**\n    *   If this is a downloaded workflow, you may be missing a node pack. In ComfyUI’s `custom_nodes` folder, make sure you have the latest **Flux Kontext** and **Comfyroll** packs.\n    Here’s a PowerShell command to quickly list what you’ve got installed:\n    ```powershell\n    Get-ChildItem -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\ComfyUI\\custom_nodes\" -Directory | Select-Object Name\n    ```\n    Compare that list to the workflow’s requirements (often posted alongside it).\n4.  **Quick reset option**\n    *   Delete the broken group node and drag in a fresh copy of **Flux Kontext Image Edit** from the node menu.\n    *   Reconnect your wires. This clears the stale reference to node `6`.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ In short:  \nThe error means the group node is trying to pull from an input slot that no longer exists. Fix it by opening the group and rewiring the input, or replace the group node with a fresh one from your installed node list.\n\nDo you want me to walk you through **repairing it step-by-step inside the group node**, or would you prefer I give you a PowerShell script to scan your workflow JSON for broken input references so you can patch them outside ComfyUI?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Okay, I'm colorblind, so I don't see a purple one, and there's two group nodes called FluxContextImageEdit. So, what, uh, and when I double-click them, nothing happens. So, I don't know, are they really group nodes?","role":"user"},{"content":"Thought for 24s\n\nTo open group nodes in ComfyUI, look for the \"Group\" node with a folded icon. You may need to right-click and select “Edit Group” or press G. Group nodes, created with Ctrl+G, show a green \"Edit\" button at the top. If double-click doesn’t work, click the \"Edit\" pill on the header to open the internal graph.\n\nIt seems like there's an error related to child 142:1 slot 0, which doesn't provide much insight directly. To troubleshoot, try muting or disabling nodes by selecting and pressing M, or use the \"Bypass\" toggle. If you're comfortable with PowerShell, consider saving the workflow as JSON, opening it in an editor, and searching for references to the problematic node. I can provide a script to validate and report missing links in groups.\n\nTo troubleshoot the error, try these steps: Start by unplugging the IMAGE input of the failing node and running it to see if the error continues. Alternatively, click the \"Edit\" badge at the top to open the group. If it doesn't open, verify you're not in \"Preview Area\" and try pressing CTRL+E. Also, consider colorblind-friendly directions using icons.\n\nTo edit a group in ComfyUI, click the \"Edit\" button in the header—double-click may not work depending on your build. Inside, check for an \"Input\" node with the name \"images\" in slot 0 and ensure it's connected. If missing, add a new \"Input\" node and connect it. Alternatively, you can delete the Flux Kontext group nodes and reload fresh ones from the panel. Ensure to address cached group definitions with related PowerShell commands.\n\nDone\n\nYep—those two boxes labeled “Flux Kontext Image Edit” **are** group nodes. In ComfyUI, group nodes show a small **“Edit”** pill in their title bar (yours have that). Double-click doesn’t always enter a group; you need to click that **Edit** pill.\n\n### Do this (fast path)\n\n1.  **Click the small “Edit” pill** on the top of each “Flux Kontext Image Edit” node.\n    *   When it works you’ll “zoom into” the group (you’ll see a breadcrumb at the top).\n    *   If nothing happens, hit **Ctrl+Shift+R** to hard-reload the UI tab, then try again.\n2.  Inside the group, look for an **unconnected red socket** on an **Input** node (it’ll be the _first_ input, slot 0). That’s the “missing node 6”.\n3.  Reconnect that input to the correct signal _from the group’s inputs panel_ (right sidebar shows the group’s external inputs). If you don’t see the expected external input, add one, then wire it to the internal place that’s red.\n4.  Back out (breadcrumb), **Save**, then **Run**.\n\n### If “Edit” still won’t open or this is annoying\n\nJust replace the broken group(s):\n\n*   Delete both “Flux Kontext Image Edit” nodes.\n*   Add fresh ones from your node list and re-wire IMAGE/CONDITION/CFG/etc.  \n    (These JSON group nodes can get stale; re-adding clears the ghost reference.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Quick checks (Windows / PowerShell)\n\n**1) See what custom node folders you actually have:**\n\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\ComfyUI\\custom_nodes\" -Directory | Select-Object Name\n```\n\n**2) Inspect your exported workflow JSON for the bad link**  \n(Export your current graph to a file first; then run this—updates only the path.)\n\n```powershell\n$wf = Get-Content \"C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\workflow.json\" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json\n\n# Map node IDs to titles for readability\n$nodeMap = @{}\n$wf.nodes | ForEach-Object { $nodeMap[[string]$_.id] = $_.title }\n\n# Find links that reference a missing node or look like your error (node 6 / child 142:1 slot 0)\n$links = $wf.links | ForEach-Object {\n    [pscustomobject]@{\n        LinkId      = $_[0]\n        FromNodeId  = $_[1]\n        FromSlot    = $_[2]\n        ToNodeId    = $_[3]\n        ToSlot      = $_[4]\n        Type        = $_[5]\n        FromTitle   = $nodeMap[[string]$_[1]]\n        ToTitle     = $nodeMap[[string]$_[3]]\n    }\n}\n\n\"--- Links touching node 6 or node 142 ---\"\n$links | Where-Object { $_.FromNodeId -eq 6 -or $_.ToNodeId -eq 6 -or $_.FromNodeId -eq 142 -or $_.ToNodeId -eq 142 } |\n    Format-Table LinkId,Type,FromNodeId,FromTitle,FromSlot,ToNodeId,ToTitle,ToSlot\n\n# Report links whose node IDs don't exist in the node list (dangling)\n$validIds = @($wf.nodes.id)\n\"`n--- Dangling links (node IDs not present) ---\"\n$links | Where-Object { $validIds -notcontains $_.FromNodeId -or $validIds -notcontains $_.ToNodeId } |\n    Format-Table LinkId,Type,FromNodeId,FromTitle,ToNodeId,ToTitle\n```\n\n*   If you see a link where `ToSlot = 0` and it points into one of the Flux Kontext groups, that’s your broken inlet.
