Let’s unwrap this psych-biblical burrito.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧔🏼‍♂️ **Who is John of Patmos?**\n\nJohn of Patmos is traditionally credited as the author of **the Book of Revelation**, the last—and by far the most metal—book in the Christian Bible. Here's the backstory:\n\n*   He was supposedly **exiled** to the Greek island of **Patmos** by Roman authorities around **95 CE** during a crackdown on early Christians.\n*   Patmos is a rocky, mystical-feeling island in the Aegean Sea. Picture volcanic hills, caves, and long, trance-inducing views of the ocean—**perfect apocalypse-writing territory.**\n*   While there, John claims he had a **series of intense visions** that were \"revealed\" to him by Jesus (thus _Revelation_), and he wrote them down in the style of wild prophetic poetry mixed with dream logic and cosmic violence.\n\nImportant caveat:  \nNobody knows _for sure_ who “John” was. Some think he was the same guy as the Apostle John, some think he was a completely different rando prophet. Biblical scholars fight about it like he's Banksy.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📖 **What’s the deal with the Book of Revelation?**\n\nIt’s **pure batshit prophecy** and **some of the most hallucinatory text** in all of Western literature. Just some light highlights:\n\n*   Beasts with **seven heads**, **ten horns**, and **blasphemous names**.\n*   A **lamb** with **seven eyes** and **seven horns** who opens **seals** that cause **famine, war, death, and hell**.\n*   A **whore of Babylon** riding a **scarlet beast** drunk on the blood of saints.\n*   An **angel** throws **Satan into a pit** for 1,000 years.\n*   The **New Jerusalem** descends from the sky as a **perfect golden cube** with walls made of **precious stones**.\n\nRevelation reads like a combo of **late-stage DMT trip**, **ancient Near East revenge fantasy**, and **progressive doom metal concept album**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎧 **Wait... Did Pink Floyd trip on Patmos or something??**\n\n**Short answer: no.** There’s no reliable historical evidence that Pink Floyd ever went to Patmos or recorded anything there.\n\nBUT…\n\nThere _is_ a kind of urban myth vibe about this, probably because:\n\n*   Patmos has long been a **mystical pilgrimage site** for seekers, hermits, and psychonauts, especially after the 60s.\n*   The **Cave of the Apocalypse**, where John supposedly had his visions, has a strong **hypnagogic vibe**. People do in fact **trip there**, sometimes on purpose, sometimes just from the intensity.\n*   Pink Floyd, especially during the **Syd Barrett** era, had a _reputation_ for being cosmic, mystic, and borderline religious in their acid use and themes.\n*   It’s possible some **hippie or underground psych band** recorded on or near Patmos in the 60s–70s, and the story just got **Floyd-washed** over time, like how every haunted house becomes \"where Kurt Cobain stayed once.\"\n\nIn short:\n\n> 🎙️ “No, Pink Floyd didn’t record on Patmos. But if they had, it would’ve sounded like a Hammond organ melting through a stained glass window while a lion with seven wings eats a synthesizer.” – me, just now\n\n* * *\n\nIf you _want_ a band that _feels_ like they recorded in the Book of Revelation, try:\n\n*   **Current 93**\n*   **Dead Can Dance**\n*   **Swans (late era)**\n*   **Godspeed You! Black Emperor**\n\nOr just queue up _Echoes_ from _Meddle_ and imagine John scribbling about lakes of fire and seven seals with the Aegean sun behind him.\n\nWanna dive deeper into Revelation lore or trace the aesthetic lineage into doom metal and evangelical fever dreams?

Is that bullshit?","role":"user"},{"content":"No, that’s _absolutely not bullshit_ — in fact, it’s one of the most widely accepted scholarly views among historians and theologians: the Book of Revelation is **a politically charged, coded polemic** against Rome, written in a kind of apocalyptic code to get past the censors (and maybe the Roman sword).\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧔 Who Wrote Revelation?\n\n*   Likely written by a Christian prophet named **John**, exiled on the island of **Patmos**.\n*   Not the same as the author of the Gospel of John (despite the name overlap).\n*   Written around **90–95 CE**, under **Emperor Domitian**, a notoriously brutal persecutor of Christians.\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚔️ What Was Happening Politically?\n\n*   **Rome was the world superpower**, often demanding emperor worship.\n*   Christians were seen as **subversive weirdos** who wouldn’t honor the emperor as divine.\n*   The Jewish Temple had been destroyed in 70 CE.\n*   Tensions were high between oppressed early Christians and the dominant imperial state.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🏛️ So What’s the Allegory?\n\n#### **The Beast = Rome**\n\n*   The multi-headed Beast rising from the sea? Almost certainly **the Roman Empire**, with its seven heads symbolizing either:\n    *   The **Seven Hills of Rome**, or\n    *   A string of Roman **emperors**.\n\n#### **Babylon = Rome**\n\n*   “Babylon” in Revelation is code for **Rome**, drawing from Old Testament imagery of Babylon as the archetypal oppressor.\n*   The “Whore of Babylon” dressed in luxury, drunk on the blood of saints? Think **decadent Roman elite** reveling in the persecution of Christians.\n\n#### **The Mark of the Beast (666)**\n\n*   One widely accepted interpretation is that **666 = Nero Caesar**, using gematria (a Hebrew letter-number code).\n*   Nero was infamous for persecuting Christians — think of him as Revelation’s proto-Antichrist.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 Why So Obscure and Psychedelic Then?\n\nBecause **you couldn’t just publish anti-Roman manifestos** in the empire without getting killed.\n\nSo John used:\n\n*   **Apocalyptic imagery** (borrowed from earlier Jewish texts like _Daniel_ and _Enoch_)\n*   **Symbolism** and **numerology** (666, 7 seals, 4 horsemen)\n*   Over-the-top visuals that smuggle his message past the censors but ring loud and clear to insiders\n\nBasically: _Revelation is a protest text_, dressed up in a firestorm of angels, monsters, cosmic war, and throne rooms made of crystal.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 So Was It Meant to Predict the End of the World?\n\nNot necessarily. That’s more of a _later_ interpretation (esp. medieval and modern Christian readings).

You're absolutely describing the classic eschatology-adjacent childhood pipeline: \"I'm not religious, I just obsessively studied the end of the world starting in kindergarten.\" (You’re in good company — a lot of the best weirdos and speculative thinkers came from that exact crucible.)\n\nLet’s talk Nostradamus:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙‍♂️ WHO WAS THIS GUY?\n\n**Michel de Nostredame** (a.k.a. _Nostradamus_)\n\n*   Born **1503**, died **1566**.\n*   Lived in **France** during the Renaissance, right in the middle of the plague, religious wars, and general chaos.\n*   Originally trained as a **physician** — he was respected for treating plague victims (sometimes successfully, often not).\n*   But he was also:\n    *   An **astrologer**\n    *   An **alchemist**\n    *   A poet\n    *   A sort of “gentleman mystic” with a flair for public performance\n\nSo, basically: Renaissance Chaos Wizard vibes.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💰 WAS HE RICH?\n\nNot **born rich**, but he **got rich** — partly through:\n\n1.  **Medical work** (especially during plague outbreaks, when demand was high and risk was higher)\n2.  **Publishing books**, including:\n    *   _The Prophecies_ (his most famous, 1555)\n    *   Various almanacs (predicting weather, harvests, etc.)\n    *   Astrology-based cures and guides\n\nAnd he became a **court celebrity**, especially after Queen **Catherine de' Medici** (wife of King Henry II of France) consulted him. That royal patronage helped seal his reputation and protect him.\n\nSo yeah — **he made his way up the ladder** from plague-doctor to court mystic.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📜 WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY _WRITE_?\n\nHe’s most famous for _Les Prophéties_, a book of **942 quatrains** (four-line poems) written in:\n\n*   **Archaic French**\n*   With a ton of **wordplay**, **anagrams**, **Latin**, **Greek**, and sometimes **Hebrew**\n*   Intentionally **vague and cryptic** — he even admitted that he _meant_ to obscure the meanings\n\nThis was partly to avoid being arrested for heresy, but also to create an aura of mystique and timelessness.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔮 DID HE ACTUALLY PREDICT ANYTHING?\n\nThat’s... _complicated_. Here's the real talk:\n\n*   Many of the predictions only _seem_ accurate **after the fact**, thanks to vague language and creative interpretation.\n*   He _didn’t_ predict Hitler by name (despite what tabloids said — the “Hister” line was probably about the **Danube River** region, which was called Hister).\n*   He _didn’t_ predict 9/11 (those viral quatrains were made up in the 2000s).\n\nBut he did make _some_ eerily close calls. A few examples people point to:\n\n*   The death of King Henry II by lance to the eye (which actually happened)\n*   Fires and floods that hit specific French towns\n*   A few European political shifts and weather events\n\nStill — these are often **retrofits**.
