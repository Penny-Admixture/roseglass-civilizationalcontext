Let me break it down and recommend what you can best run **right now** and what to prepare for **later**, based on your goals and current collection:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔧 **Your Goal: \"Tell it to run apps, automate UI, and code reliably\"**\n\nTo get there, you need:\n\n1.  **Strong code reasoning** (understands APIs, system calls, etc.)\n2.  **High task memory/long context**\n3.  **Good at following step-by-step instructions**\n4.  **Toolformer-like capabilities** (if we're dreaming bigger—i.e. planning and executing in multiple steps)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **Best Models You Already Installed for Coding/UI Control**\n\n#### ✅ **Saul-Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-Ties-i1-GGUF (Q6\\_K\\_M or Q4\\_NL)**\n\n*   **Strengths:** Balanced, sharp, conversational, decent code-writing.\n*   **Limit:** Can **suggest code and commands**, but can't actually touch UI (yet).\n*   **Use it when:** You want general instruction-following, verbose explanations, and decent code suggestions in a small footprint.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 **BUT if you're chasing raw coding capability and automation planning:**\n\n#### 🔥 **Install These Next:**\n\n1.  **CodeLlama-34B-Instruct (or 13B if RAM-limited)**\n    *   Best open-source coding brain. Can refactor whole files, suggest shell scripts, etc.\n    *   Needs ~25GB for **13B**, ~45GB for **34B** Q4 level.\n    *   **Get this if you want an \"IDE in a brain.\"**\n2.  **Deepseek-Coder 33B (or 6.7B)**\n    *   Incredible for actual _system-level logic_ and multi-step planning.\n    *   Will even suggest Windows APIs for automation.\n    *   33B is slow but doable if you're patient.\n    *   **Recommended quant: Q4\\_K\\_M or Q5\\_K\\_M**\n3.  **WizardCoder (7B or 13B)**\n    *   Very focused on instruction → code generation.\n    *   Lacks some personality, but **great for \"write me a macro for this exact use case\"** type prompts.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ For UI Automation (“touch my soundboard, open VS Code” etc):\n\nYou’ll eventually need to **pair the LLM with an automation layer**, like:\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) or [OpenInterpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) | Convert LLM outputs to real OS actions (file, terminal, apps) |\n| [TextGen WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) + Extensions | For chaining steps and plugging into APIs |\n| \\[LM Studio + Python Script\\] | Use the LLM for codegen, then pipe results to Python scripts that control your OS |\n\n> ⚠️ No local model yet natively “clicks buttons” or uses UI directly—but you can **generate AutoHotkey, PowerShell, or Python automation scripts** and execute those. That’s your bridge.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 My Recommendation for You Right Now\n\nSince you don’t care about “vibe” here:\n\n1.  ✅ **Use Saul-Nous-Hermes Q6\\_K\\_M** for verbose logic-heavy prompts. Try:\n    ```\n    I want to automate switching between VS Code and Brave every 10 minutes, and play a sound from my soundboard each time. Write me a working AutoHotkey or PowerShell script for Windows 10.\n    ```\n2.  🔜 **Install Deepseek-Coder 6.7B Q4\\_K\\_M** — great middle-ground coding brain.\n3.  🔮 **If you go 33B+, pick Deepseek-Coder 33B or CodeLlama 34B-Instruct.** They’re the best we’ve got under 100B.\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to build a “toolchain launcher prompt” preset for you that wraps this all up into a single LLM instruction format?
