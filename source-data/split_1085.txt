Here's how:\n\n#### **Step 1: Install Windows Driver Kit (WDK)**\n\n1.  Download and install it from Microsoft:  \n    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk\n2.  During installation, make sure you enable the option:\n    > **\"Install Windows 11 SDK\"** (if it’s not already installed).\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠 Step 2: Set Environment Variable (Optional but helpful)\n\nAfter installation, you may want to ensure your include paths can find `ntstatus.h`.\n\nIf it's installed at something like:\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Include\\10.0.22621.0\\shared\\ntstatus.h\n```\n\nYou can either:\n\n*   Add that path to your include environment variables, or\n*   Temporarily modify the `Makefile.win` to add an `/I` include line pointing there.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 Optional: Confirm the header is visible\n\nYou can test by running this command in the same prompt:\n\n```powershell\ndir \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Include\\*\\shared\\ntstatus.h\"\n```\n\nIt should show one or more hits.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧩 If You're Still Blocked...\n\nIf you just want to **install pgvector quickly** without building it yourself, an easier path on Windows is:\n\n#### ✔️ Use `CREATE EXTENSION` if you're using PostgreSQL from \\[EnterpriseDB or BigSQL\\]\n\nIf pgvector is already available in your install:\n\n```sql\nCREATE EXTENSION vector;\n```\n\nIf it fails with `extension \"vector\" is not available`, you can check:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'vector';\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Alternative: Use `pgxn` (PostgreSQL Extension Network)\n\nSome users have success with this PowerShell-based approach:\n\n```powershell\ngit clone https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector\ncd pgvector\n\"$env:PGROOT\\bin\\pg_config.exe\"  # confirm this path\n```\n\nAnd then build using:\n\n```powershell\nSet-Location pgvector\n& \"$env:PGROOT\\bin\\pg_config.exe\"  # confirm again\nnmake /F Makefile.win\nnmake /F Makefile.win install\n```\n\nBut you'll still need the WDK unless you comment out lines using `ntstatus.h` (not recommended).\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want to try the `pgxn` method or I can give you a full PowerShell script that checks and installs all dependencies.","role":"assistant"}]}

It uses a token/graph metaphor to explore relationships between uploaded files, analysis results, and system state. The UI is minimal but modular, ideal for further expansion into creative or research tools.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧱 Tech Stack\n\n*   **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) + Vite + TailwindCSS\n*   **Backend**: Node.js (TypeScript) using Express-style routing\n*   **Database**: Drizzle ORM (SQLite assumed)\n*   **State Management**: React Query\n*   **Live Data**: WebSockets\n*   **UI Library**: ShadCN-based component system (in `client/src/components/ui`)\n\n* * *\n\n### 📂 Folder Structure (important highlights)\n\n```\nMediaMind/\n├── client/                 # Frontend\n│   └── src/\n│       ├── components/     # Main UI & Graph Panels\n│       ├── pages/          # Route views\n│       └── services/       # API & WS logic\n├── server/                 # Backend logic\n│   ├── ai-pipeline.ts      # Placeholder for AI feature plumbing\n│   └── routes.ts           # API endpoints\n├── shared/schema.ts        # Shared types/validation schema\n├── uploads/                # File dropzone endpoint\n└── attached_assets/\n    └── Pasted--Typestrata-Backend-Design-Specification...txt\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🚀 Getting Started (Local)\n\n```bash\n# 1.
