Let’s start with the **Dallas scene**, then zoom out.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 First, the therapeutic origins (briefly for context):\n\n*   **MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)** was synthesized in 1912 by Merck, but it wasn't until the **late 1970s** that it started being used in **psychotherapy**, largely thanks to chemist **Alexander Shulgin**, who rediscovered and self-tested it.\n*   Shulgin introduced it to **Leo Zeff**, a retired psychotherapist, who trained hundreds of underground therapists. In that scene, it was called **“Adam,”** and it was used for couples therapy, trauma processing, and more.\n*   MDMA was still legal at this time.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🍸 Then comes **Dallas, Texas** — Ground Zero of recreational MDMA\n\nBy the **early 1980s**, word of mouth started leaking from therapists and insiders. But it wasn’t the hippies or club kids who got there first. It was **oil money yuppies and socialites** in **Dallas**.\n\n#### Why Dallas?\n\n*   There was a unique convergence of factors:\n    *   A **booming economy**, thanks to oil and real estate.\n    *   A **well-connected social scene** of bored rich professionals looking for something new.\n    *   Local access to MDMA via underground chemists and psychonauts in Texas and California.\n    *   A culture that already mixed pills and party vibes (quaaludes, coke, speed were around too).\n\n#### What did it look like?\n\n*   It was **legal** at the time, sold openly in some bars as “Empathy,” “Adam,” or “X.”\n*   Clubs like **Starck Club** (opened 1984, designed by Philippe Starck) became legendary.\n    *   The scene was upscale, glamorous, not what we’d call rave-y yet. More **Velvet Underground meets Vogue**.\n    *   There were **no glowsticks**, but a ton of **openhearted conversation, emotional bonding**, and very sweaty designer shirts.\n*   People would talk for hours in bathrooms, cry on couches, and hug people they'd just met — you know, _MDMA things_.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌍 Simultaneous and later scenes around the world\n\nWhile **Dallas** was the flagship for U.S. recreational MDMA use, similar pockets started emerging:\n\n#### 🇺🇸 San Francisco / West Coast\n\n*   Already steeped in psychedelic culture, MDMA filtered into **New Age and gay party scenes**.\n*   Used both in spiritual workshops and dance parties (pre-rave).\n*   Ecstatic dance, tantra, and conscious sexuality workshops sometimes used MDMA before it was banned.\n\n#### 🇬🇧 UK: Ibiza → Manchester → London\n\n*   **Ibiza**, already a hippie and Euro tourist spot, started getting MDMA by the **mid-to-late 1980s**.\n*   DJs brought it back to **Manchester** clubs like **The Haçienda**, mixing it with house music from Chicago and Detroit.\n*   This kicked off the **Second Summer of Love (1988–1989)** and the birth of UK rave culture.\n\n#### 🇩🇪 Berlin\n\n*   Post-wall Berlin had a huge **underground techno scene**, and MDMA played a role in the **utopian queer/leftist squat party scene** of the early 90s.\n*   Places like **Tresor** became temples of MDMA + industrial minimalism.\n\n#### 🇳🇱 Netherlands\n\n*   Very early harm reduction culture — by the late 80s and early 90s, **Dutch pill testing** and “smart shops” created a more **informed and accepted MDMA subculture**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬 What makes the Dallas scene special?\n\n*   It’s this **strange missing link** between:\n    *   Clinical/therapeutic MDMA\n    *   Yuppie consumerism\n    *   The eventual rave explosion\n*   It shows that **MDMA’s emotional power** transcended subcultural boundaries.\n    *   Not just for hippies or punks.\n    *   But for real estate agents, lawyers, and bankers who suddenly _felt things_ and didn’t know what to do with that.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🚨 Crackdown & Schedule I\n\n*   In **1985**, the DEA emergency-scheduled MDMA as a **Schedule I substance**, bypassing much of the therapeutic and research community.\n*   This drove MDMA underground, but its legend had already spread — and set the stage for **rave culture** and global **party pharmacology**.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want to dive into this deeper, some sources worth checking out:\n\n*   _Ecstasy: The Complete Guide_ by Julie Holland (great on therapeutic and historical aspects)\n*   _E for Ecstasy_ by Nicholas Saunders (also has lots on Dallas and early use)\n*   Documentaries on the **Starck Club** — there are interviews with people from that scene who describe how _transformative and weirdly classy_ it all was.\n\nWant me to write a zine-style summary of “The Forgotten MDMA Scene of Dallas 1983”? Because that deserves a pamphlet.","role":"assistant"}]}

You’ve already internalized half of what most people _never_ get about using image-to-image creatively. Let’s break this down like a ComfyUI cheat sheet, and then I’ll tell you exactly how to get those _true_ variations — like the good old days — injected with chaos and tuned for exploration, not refinement.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎛️ THE FLOW YOU'RE DOING NOW (🔥 and legit):\n\n*   **Input**: a photo (e.g. hotel plate glass + coke lines)\n*   **Prompt**: maybe mild, or even empty\n*   **Denoise**: ~0.5\n    *   This is perfect for _prompt-weighted dream-echoes_ where the image is still there but stylized\n*   **Sampler**: likely Euler a or DPM++ 2M Karras?\n*   **CFG**: probably ~3 to 7 range\n*   Result: beautiful, haunted mood collages where the city behind you starts turning into chrome dreams or post-singularity Atlanta or whatever your prompt vibe injects\n\n* * *\n\n### 👁️ How to Get _\"Real\" Image Variations_ (promptless, chaotic, divergent)\n\nThese behave like remixing with **injected seed variation** rather than prompt influence:\n\n#### 🧠 Strategy A: **Manual Latent Variations (with Noise Injection)**\n\nIn ComfyUI:\n\n1.  **Input image**\n2.  Use **`Image to Latent`**\n3.  Plug into **`Latent Noise Injection`** or add noise manually with a **`Latent Add Noise`** node\n4.  Use a **Latent to Image** decoder (typically with VAE)\n5.  Adjust:\n    *   **Noise level** (e.g., 0.2 to 0.6 is where you get interesting mutations)\n    *   Seed: randomize it per run\n6.  Loop it (use a **RepeatNode** or **BatchLatentVariations** custom node)\n\nThis gives you:\n\n*   _40 chaotic but coherent reinterpretations_\n*   No need for a text prompt (though you _can_ mix one in subtly at low CFG)\n*   _Control over entropy_ via injected noise\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ Strategy B: **Use IPAdapter + MultiInput for Variations**\n\nUse the [IPAdapter](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui-ipadapter) node for:\n\n*   Multiple source images (say: plate on window + skyline)\n*   A loose text prompt (e.g., “elevated dreamscape, red light ambiance”)\n*   Low CFG and moderate denoise (0.4–0.6)\n\nWith:\n\n*   **`IPAdapter Advanced`** or `Plus Face` variant\n*   **Chaos via randomized seed + noise injection**\n\nLet it rip for 30+ images and harvest what you love.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌀 Bonus: If You Want to Feed the Results BACK Into Latent Space\n\nYou can even:\n\n*   Take your favorite outputs\n*   Feed them _back in_ with new noise\n*   Adjust denoise upward to 0.6–0.8\n*   Add glitch passes, overlays, or double-latent mixing with other photos from the same era\n\nThis creates that recursive, haunted-glass quality you’re chasing — where it feels like multiple timelines are phasing through one vision.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you upload one of those Peachtree hotel images here, I’ll:\n\n1.  Process it into a clean latent base\n2.  Show you exactly what variation chains to build\n3.
