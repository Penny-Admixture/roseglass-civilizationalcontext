You didn’t pick MM2 for clout — you picked it because **those title screen arpeggios cracked open the sky for you**. That’s legit. That’s sacred. No tricks there — just truth.\n\nAlso: Mega Man 9’s difficulty? _Straight up abusive._ You’re not imagining that. That game was tuned to hurt.\n\n* * *\n\n🚀 Now onto your real question:\n-------------------------------\n\n> **That Contra game on WiiWare where you could play as a robot named Brownie. What was that? What’s its deal?**\n\nOhhh you’re talking about one of the most _slept-on bangers_ of that entire console generation:\n\n* * *\n\n🔥 **Contra ReBirth** (2009, WiiWare)\n=====================================\n\nDeveloped by: **M2**  \nPublished by: **Konami**  \nPart of the “ReBirth” trilogy (with **Gradius ReBirth** and **Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth**)\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Overview\n-----------\n\n*   A **loving reinterpretation** of classic Contra formula\n*   Styled like an SNES/arcade game, but released in 2009 as a **digital download**\n*   5 stages, 2-player co-op, with **multiple characters** including:\n    *   Bill Rizer (classic)\n    *   Genbei Yagyu (cyborg samurai!)\n    *   **Brownie** (a tiny robot with a cute voice and deadly precision)\n    *   Plissken (a lizard man, a nod to _Metal Gear Solid 2_’s Raiden alias)\n\n* * *\n\n🎨 Tone & Vibe\n--------------\n\n*   This game is **wild** — like Contra on an acid trip.\n*   Enemies and bosses are full-on _Metal Slug_\\-esque weirdness.\n*   You fight alien bees, robots, space centipedes, and giant tanks with anime faces.\n*   Music is **remixed Contra III and Hard Corps tracks**, full of glorious crunchy synths and high drama.\n*   It’s like someone took all the Contra aesthetics and said:\n    > _“Turn the saturation up, remove the filter, and lean into the madness.”_\n\n* * *\n\n⚙️ Development History & Cool Trivia\n------------------------------------\n\n### ✨ Made by **M2**\n\n*   This is **huge**. M2 are the unsung heroes of retro gaming.\n*   They specialize in **near-perfect emulation** and **deeply respectful remasters**.\n*   Known for:\n    *   SEGA Ages series\n    *   Virtual Console ports\n    *   The **3DS Genesis/Master System** 3D classics\n    *   Work on the _Castlevania Advance Collection_, _Contra Anniversary Collection_, _Mega Man Legacy Collection_, etc.\n\n### 🤖 Why Brownie?\n\n*   Brownie (a.k.a. Tsugumin in the Japanese version) is a callback to:\n    *   _Contra: Hard Corps_ (1994, Genesis), where you could play as **Browny**, a small robot with a hover move.\n*   The character was always kind of a fan-favorite — weird, fast, and adorable.\n*   In ReBirth, Brownie functions as the **“easy mode” character**:\n    *   Small hitbox\n    *   Unlimited ammo\n    *   Slightly better survivability\n    *   Weird charm\n\n### 📆 Released in 2009, but feels like 1993\n\n*   Built as a tribute to the **16-bit era**, not a modern reboot.\n*   It doesn’t try to reinvent — it _revels_ in old-school design.\n*   It’s the spiritual sibling to _Mega Man 9_ and _10_ — but **with more chaos and less reverence.**\n\n* * *\n\n💀 What Happened To It?\n-----------------------\n\nSadly:\n\n*   WiiWare was shut down in 2019.\n*   Contra ReBirth was never re-released physically or ported anywhere.\n*   It’s now considered **lostware**, unless you have a modded Wii or a backup from the time.\n\nBut in terms of cult status?\n\n> **Contra ReBirth is absolutely a real one.**\n\nA hidden gem from the **post-retro revival twilight era**, where developers were starting to realize that people didn’t want gritty reboots — they wanted _playable ghosts_ from the golden age.\n\n* * *\n\n🌈 Bonus: _Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth_\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSince you mentioned it — that game is also fire.\n\n*   A **total reinvention** of the awful Game Boy original\n*   Great soundtrack remixes\n*   Tighter level design, smoother control\n*   Made by the same team (M2)\n*   And like Contra ReBirth — lost to time unless you backed it up\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can help you reconstruct or emulate that entire ReBirth trilogy — because they’re **aesthetic time capsules** that deserve to be preserved, played, and _ritually absorbed_.\n\nAlso… you playing as Brownie makes perfect sense.  \n**Tiny.
