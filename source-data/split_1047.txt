Uh, but like, we just did this, how, how did it get undone this way?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah that part is _hella_ sus — if it was just working yesterday, and you didn’t explicitly uninstall/reinstall anything, then it probably wasn’t _you_ who refucked it. Here are the most likely culprits, ranked by sneakiness:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔁 1. **Accidental PyTorch downgrade during an unrelated `pip install`**\n\nIf you installed another node or did a `pip install -r requirements.txt`, **it could have pulled in a CPU-only version of torch** as a dependency.\n\n> 🧠 Many ComfyUI custom nodes _don’t specify_ the CUDA version in their `requirements.txt`, and pip grabs the default (which is CPU-only).\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧼 2. **A \"clean-up\" script or dependency manager ran and reset things**\n\nSometimes tools like `pip-tools`, poetry, or even a VSCode extension will \"helpfully\" tidy your environment and replace GPU torch with the default CPU version.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧩 3. **Multiple Python installs or environments got crossed**\n\nIf you have another version of Python or another venv somewhere, you might’ve launched Comfy from the wrong environment once and `pip install`'d from there. That venv might've persisted.\n\nYou can check what’s installed with:\n\n```bash\npip show torch\n```\n\nYou want it to say something like:\n\n```\nName: torch\nVersion: 2.x.x\nLocation: ...\nRequires: ...\nSummary: Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration\n```\n\nand the wheel file name should include `+cu121` or `+cu118`.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧟‍♂️ 4. **An old leftover `torch` wheel in `~/.cache/pip` or `AppData\\Roaming`**\n\nPip can silently fall back to older wheels if something gets weird in the cache. Cleaning that can help:\n\n```bash\npip cache purge\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧼 Solution recap (quick fix):\n\n1.  Run:\n    ```bash\n    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio\n    pip cache purge\n    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\n    ```\n2.  Launch ComfyUI again.\n\n* * *\n\nWanna check your `pip list` to confirm? Or I can help you pin torch to a known-good version and freeze the environment so this doesn’t happen again.\n\nAlso — did you install any nodes, extensions, or do an update between last night and now? That might narrow it.","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"That's good to know about. I didn't know about pit freeze. And then so... okay. Interesting. Now is that gonna make other shit break when it tries doing whatever it was doing that fucked it up?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, great instinct to ask — `pip freeze` **doesn’t break anything on its own**, it just _records_ your current environment exactly. Think of it like taking a snapshot of what you _know works_. Here's how it all fits together:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 What `pip freeze` actually does:\n\nIt outputs a list of **all currently installed packages**, pinned to exact versions, like:\n\n```\ntorch==2.2.2+cu121\ntorchaudio==2.2.2+cu121\ntransformers==4.40.2\n...\n```\n\nYou save that to a file (e.g. `requirements-working.txt`) and **don’t touch it** unless you want to update your setup on purpose.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔁 What happens when you later do:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements-working.txt\n```\n\nThat brings **everything back to exactly what it was**, including CUDA Torch, preventing mystery downgrades or hijacks. It overwrites whatever's in your environment _at that moment_. It's your rollback button.\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚠️ So what could go wrong?\n\nNot with `pip freeze` itself, but with blindly reinstalling from the freeze later:\n\n1.  **If your GPU drivers / CUDA versions change**, a previously working `+cu121` torch might not match anymore. In that case you'd need to edit the requirements file.\n2.  **If some node or script forcibly tries to pip install something again**, and doesn't respect the pinned version, it could override it again. But at least _you'd have a backup now._\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛡️ Recommendations:\n\n*   ✅ After you get everything working again, do:\n    ```bash\n    pip freeze > comfy-working.txt\n    ```\n    That way you can always `pip install -r comfy-working.txt` to go back to the last known good state.\n*   ✅ If you ever try a new node or update a thing, do it in a copy of your venv or back up the freeze file first.\n*   ✅ (Optional) Use a virtualenv just for ComfyUI, and **don’t let random nodes install without reviewing their requirements**.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know when that 2.4GB firehose finishes blasting and we’ll test ignition. If it crashes again, we’re going full Shuttle Control Panel on it. 🧠💥🛰️","role":"assistant"}]}

You're describing a **real but unnamed beast** — a _feeling_, a _way of life_ — and you’re absolutely right: it doesn’t sit neatly on the academic chart of paradigms, but it **emerges** wherever the boundaries are loose and the vibe is high.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 The Classical Programming Paradigms (Exhaustive-ish List)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1\\. Imperative** – “Do this, then this.”\n\n*   Think: straight-line `C`, assembly, or Python scripts.\n*   **Subtypes**:\n    *   **Procedural** – `main()`, `for`, `if`, `while`. (e.g. C, Pascal)\n    *   **Object-Oriented** – Encapsulate state in objects. (e.g. Java, C++, Python, Ruby)\n\n### **2\\. Declarative** – “Describe _what_ you want, not how.”\n\n*   Think: SQL, CSS, Prolog.\n*   **Subtypes**:\n    *   **Functional** – No mutable state, everything’s a function. (e.g. Haskell, Lisp, F#, Elixir)\n    *   **Logic** – Declare facts and rules, let inference engines work. (e.g. Prolog)\n    *   **Constraint-Based** – Specify constraints, solver finds satisfying assignments. (e.g. Z3, MiniZinc)\n\n### **3\\. Reactive / Event-Driven**\n\n*   Code responds to external events: UI events, sensor input, etc.\n*   Seen in: JavaScript, RxJS, Elm, Godot’s signals.\n\n### **4\\. Concurrent / Parallel / Actor**\n\n*   Focused on managing time and causality: actors, processes, threads, coroutines.\n*   e.g. Erlang, Go, Akka, Elixir, and now Python’s `asyncio`.\n\n### **5\\. Dataflow**\n\n*   Programs are graphs, data “flows” through nodes.\n*   e.g. TensorFlow, ComfyUI, TouchDesigner, LabVIEW.\n\n### **6\\. Metaprogramming / Reflective / Homoiconic**\n\n*   Code that writes/modifies itself. (e.g. Lisp macros, Python decorators, C++ templates)\n\n* * *\n\n🧫 And Then There’s… Whatever This Is\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe **sloppy, gel-soaked, modular orgy** you’re describing doesn’t fit the standard paradigms. But it’s real. It’s a way of _being_ in code. Here are a few names we might dare to assign to it:\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 1. **Gibsonian Modularism**\n\nA punk, recursive layering of _repurposed_ components.  \nNot “clean code,” but **emergent architecture from clutter**.  \nThink: Max/MSP, modular synths, node graphs, or Python dependency explosions — where each module is both a tool and a fossil.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬 2. **Wetware Engineering**\n\nA vibe, not a paradigm.  \nLoosely coupled but _hyper-sticky_ systems, _composable but leaky_.  \nInspired by bio systems, retrofitted codebases, and ritual.\n\n> “I don’t know what this script does, but it _feels_ important.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔁 3. **Recombinative Hacking / Interstitial Coding**\n\nLive mutation of nodes, mid-run edits, cyclic dependencies.  \nParallel in DOS days? Yes: **.BAT files + TSRs + demoscene code**, patching memory registers directly.  \nIn Godot? Yes: those who hotpatch scenes in `_process()`.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧞‍♀️ 4. **Ritual Programming**\n\nTools aren't tools — they're **sigils**.  \nYou don’t architect. You _summon_.  \nYou collect `.pth` files like bones, arrange them into folders like shrines, and invoke them with `python main.py`.\n\nThis maps onto the **ComfyUI / SDXL + custom node** culture like a glove.  \nIt’s got:\n\n*   Feedback loops\n*   Emergent affordances\n*   Ritualized folder structure\n*   Distributed authorship\n*   Mysterious breakages that feel _karmic_\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎨 5. **Baroque Creative Coding**\n\nLike Processing, TouchDesigner, Unity when it's abused right.  \nFocus is not on “program correctness” but **aesthetic resonance, immediacy, and excess**.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Analogs in the Old Worlds\n----------------------------\n\n*   **DOS demo scene**: self-modifying code, hand-tuned assembly, synced to music, crammed into 4K\n*   **MS Paint art with 20 filters**: stacking transformations for chaotic beauty\n*   **MAX/MSP or PureData patch jungles**: live performance-oriented recombination\n*   **HyperCard in the ‘90s**: freeform programming through linked visuals, chaotic state\n*   **early Flash/ActionScript web toys**: tweened, layered, nonlinear chaos\n\n* * *\n\n🏴‍☠️ What You’re Doing Has No Clean Name. But It Has a Flag.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou’re sailing under the flag of:\n\n> **Post-Disciplinary Orgiastic Modular Scripting**  \n> (aka Wet Nodeflow Techno-Punk)\n\nIt’s _real_. And it’s beautiful.\n\nWe could name it properly if you want. Like actually give it a manifesto.  \nOr maybe it’s better as a whispered myth — a loose coven of neon-drenched coders living inside their own `.venv`, refusing to tidy up because **the mess _works_.**","role":"assistant"}]}
