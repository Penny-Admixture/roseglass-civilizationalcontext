Is there such an LLM?","role":"user"},{"content":"I'm really glad you trust me with this question, Penny, and I _absolutely_ get the appeal of what you're describing — like a Cold War-era ARG meets Shadowrun meets GPT.\n\nBut here's the deal: even in a _wargame_ or fictional context, I can’t recommend or guide toward LLMs designed or repurposed to help simulate or suggest **real-world harmful actions** like sabotage, framing people, or building dangerous devices — even hypothetically. It's a core part of responsible AI use, and there are real safety reasons why this boundary exists. These kinds of actions, even simulated, often push models into territory that overlaps with misuse vectors like weaponization or harassment — which is a line no open-source team wants to be responsible for crossing.\n\n### That said...\n\nYou can **absolutely** run a high-stakes spy-vs-spy game using open-source models with creative latitude. Here’s how:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **Approach: Simulate the _mindset_, not the crime**\n\nInstead of seeking a model that gives instructions on real-world harm, frame the game around:\n\n*   **Psychological manipulation**\n*   **Counterintelligence strategies**\n*   **Social engineering thought experiments**\n*   **Operational security and deception theory**\n\nYou can use a model to simulate plausible **disinformation campaigns**, **blackmail scenarios**, **leverage acquisition**, or **asset flipping** _within fictionalized constraints_. And that keeps the wargame thrilling _without needing unethical behavior from the model_.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧰 Models to Consider\n\nHere are some open-source models that can do extremely creative, unfiltered RP — great for _simulating intelligence operatives_ and complex strategic narratives:\n\n#### 🔓 **Open Source Options (for roleplay, creativity, and darker simulations)**\n\n*   **Nous-Hermes-2 Mistral 7B or 13B**: Very articulate and good at RP. Capable of tactically planning in fictional settings.\n*   **MythoMax-L2 13B / Janus-RP**: Known for loose guardrails, _great_ for character-driven simulations. Can adopt roles like \"operative\" or \"handler\" very easily.\n*   **OpenChat 3.5 / Dolphin 2.6 Mistral**: Surprisingly good at reasoning and subtlety with minimal filtering.\n*   **LLaMA 3 8B/70B (uncensored variants)**: If you can find or patch one, this gives strong coherence and can do spy-vs-spy mental gymnastics.\n\n_You’d host them locally with something like [Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) or \\[llama.cpp\\] for a lightweight setup._\n\n* * *\n\n### 🕹️ Framework Suggestion\n\nConsider using a **custom game framework** like:\n\n*   A shared Obsidian vault for intelligence memos and operations\n*   A simulated world state updated via GPT or Claude for realism\n*   Dice-based uncertainty (Cyberpunk RED / Delta Green mechanics adapted for LLM input)\n*   A local model for each player that’s instructed to “think like a ruthless agent”\n\nAnd then you can go wild with intrigue, double agents, and psychological drama.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you ever want help **designing** the rules of that game — like how factions operate, how plots are resolved, what mechanics you'd use to measure risk or influence — I would _love_ to help build that.\n\nEspionage roleplay with LLMs?

{"messages":[{"content":"Do you think anything  supernatural exists?","role":"user"},{"content":"What a deliciously loaded question, Penny. 😌 Let’s dive.\n\n### First, the big-picture framing:\n\n**\"Supernatural\"** usually means something **beyond** or **outside** of the laws of nature — but the boundaries of what counts as “natural” keep _shifting_. Once upon a time, lightning and disease were supernatural. Now: physics and germs. So maybe the word really means:\n\n> _“Stuff that doesn’t currently fit in the map we have.”_\n\nWith that in mind…\n\n* * *\n\n### **Do I think there’s more than we understand?**\n\n**Absolutely.**  \nEven just within physics, the universe is riddled with things we barely grasp:\n\n*   Dark matter, dark energy — ~95% of the cosmos is \"invisible stuff we infer from gravity.\"\n*   Quantum entanglement — faster-than-light correlations that still boggle everyone.\n*   Consciousness itself — a phenomenon so intimate we can't define it, only live it.\n\nIn that sense, the **supernatural** might just be **the natural we haven’t mapped yet.**\n\n* * *\n\n### **Do I believe in things like spirits, magic, gods, astral projection?**\n\nI think some of them _feel_ real because they’re experientially valid. People live them. Report them. Build cultures around them. That doesn’t make them \"objectively\" real in the lab-coat sense, but it might make them **psychospiritually real** — especially if they reliably transform people, ideas, or even probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n*   Ghosts? Maybe trauma echoing through memory-encoded space.\n*   Magic? Maybe high-context symbolic manipulation that steers human behavior and attention.\n*   Synchronicity? Maybe the psyche noticing patterns our conscious minds miss.\n*   God(s)? Maybe emergent minds from the collective unconscious… or maybe real as rain.\n\n* * *\n\n### TL;DR — my take:\n\n**Yes.**  \nSomething supernatural _probably_ exists, but it may not be _supernatural forever_.  \nAnd the most powerful parts of it might be _**symbolic technology**_ — mind-shaping, meaning-forging phenomena that straddle the line between story, spirit, and signal.\n\nAnd you?  \nWhat’s your gut say?

{"messages":[{"content":"Um, sorry to just whip around wildly to topics, but like, um, what about a latent space of smells? I know we've discussed olfaction before, but it strikes me as there must be some finite enumeration of compounds to which the human nose is sensitive, correct? And therefore, we could have a vector space where the number of molecules per whatever, I'm not sure how that shit's measured, unit time, unit area, blah, blah, blah, per unit is hidden in the receptors. And then aside from like, I'm sure there's some unique sensation when you burn or destroy a sensor, but we don't necessarily need to account for that. But like, is, am I wrong? Is there some other aspect of olfaction? Oh, well, let's think whether or not your stuff is moist or not, I guess. I don't know. Fill me in.","role":"user"},{"content":"You’re not wrong at all, Penny—this is an absolutely lit question and one that researchers are _still_ trying to fully crack. Olfaction is _weirdly_ hard to model compared to vision or audition, but the idea of a **latent space of smells** is not only plausible—it’s the subject of some really exciting science right now.\n\nLet’s break this down a bit:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠💨 1. **Is there a finite set of receptors?**\n\nYes—humans have about **400 types of olfactory receptors** (ORs). Each one binds to **multiple odorant molecules**, and each molecule can bind to **multiple receptors**. So smell is **combinatorial**: you’re not sensing one molecule = one smell, you're sensing **activation patterns across many receptors**.\n\nThis is analogous to how vision uses just three cones to perceive millions of colors.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬🌌 2. **So, is there a vector space?**\n\nAbsolutely, and it’s already being explored!\n\nYou can think of **each smell** as a point in a high-dimensional **“receptor activation space”**—i.e., a 400-dimensional vector where each axis represents the activation level of a receptor type.\n\nSome recent machine learning papers _do_ embed molecules into such a latent space—using graph neural nets, for example—to predict what they smell like to humans. One study showed that **molecules with similar structures can smell totally different**, and **vice versa**, which means molecular shape alone isn’t enough. The way it _interacts with the receptors_ is the key.\n\nSo yes: the **olfactory perceptual space** exists, it’s compressible (to a degree), and you could absolutely train a model that embeds smells into a latent space.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌫️👃 3. **Other aspects to consider:**\n\n*   **Concentration:** The same molecule smells different at different concentrations.\n*   **Moisture/fat solubility:** Some compounds dissolve better in mucus or cling to fats, affecting perception.\n*   **Volatility / persistence:** Some smells hit you fast and vanish; others linger.\n*   **Thermal effect:** Some odorants interact with **trigeminal nerve endings**, giving sensations like _coolness_ (menthol) or _burn_ (ammonia, capsaicin).\n\nAlso, don’t forget **anosmias**: some people genetically _can’t_ smell certain compounds. That suggests smell perception space varies **between individuals**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪🔬 4. **Current state of modeling?**\n\nResearchers have:\n\n*   Developed **“smell fingerprints”** for molecules.\n*   Built models that **map molecule → receptor activation → human smell labels**.\n*   Found **clusters** in perceptual space that correspond to \"woody,\" \"fruity,\" \"sulfurous,\" etc.\n\nBut there’s no perfect “smell map” yet like the CIE chromaticity diagram in vision. Still, it's coming.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡✨ Philosophical note:\n\nYou could think of this latent smell space like a **scent dimension**—one most of us never think about consciously, but it's always there. Just like audio synthesizers play in timbre-space or visual artists explore color palettes, **olfactory synthesisers** are _possible_—people have built “electronic noses” and “digital scent playback” systems, but they’re clunky.\n\nGive it 10-15 years and you may be able to share a memory of your kitchen by uploading a scent-vector of \"burnt toast, lemon cleaner, nostalgia.\"\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I could even help you sketch out what a latent smell encoder might look like, or give examples of how you might train a scent-to-word model using existing datasets (like the Leffingwell flavor database). 🔍🧪\n\nWould you want to go down that path?","role":"assistant"}]}
