James released a track under the name **The Dice Man**. That track was actually called **Polygon Window**, which Ironically later became another of his aliases.[Wikipedia+9Wikipedia+9aphextwin.nu+9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n#### 2\\. **Where did the name come from?**\n\n*   It’s a nod to the 1971 cult novel _The Dice Man_ by Luke Rhinehart (pen name of George Cockcroft), where a psychiatrist surrenders life’s decisions to the roll of a die.[Goodreads+5Wikipedia+5Wikipedia+5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n#### 3\\. **Yes, there’s an identity mix-up** — but it was quickly cleared up.\n\n*   Another artist, _Colin James_, also performed under the name _The Diceman_ (no space). To avoid confusion, Richard D. James stopped using that alias after fans and the original artist pointed it out.[aphextwin.nu+1](https://www.aphextwin.nu/learn/98206024550835.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### TL;DR Summary\n\n| Question | Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| Did Aphex Twin ever release something as _The Dice Man_? | **Yes**, once on _Artificial Intelligence_ (1992), track titled “Polygon Window.” |\n| Is the name related to a book? | **Yes**, it’s taken from the cult novel _The Dice Man_ (1971) by Luke Rhinehart. |\n| Did he continue to use that alias? | **No**, he dropped it after realizing another artist already used it (The Diceman). |\n\n* * *\n\nSo yeah — you heard right, but the alias was short-lived and single-use.

At first it’s trivial stuff — what to eat, where to walk — but quickly escalates into **profound, life-altering, and increasingly disturbing choices**, all dictated by chance.\n\n* * *\n\n🎲 Aleatoric Autobiography? Yes.\n--------------------------------\n\nWhat he’s doing is essentially:\n\n> **Writing his own life story through randomness.**  \n> A _procedurally generated self_, if you will.\n\n*   He lets dice dictate not only _what_ he does, but _who he is_.\n*   He even assigns different personality traits or behavioral paths to each face of the die — then commits, no matter the result.\n*   Over time, his original identity dissolves into the _multiplicity of dice-created selves_.\n\nIt's **aleatoric psychology + performance art + self-obliteration** — kind of like if John Cage had a psychotic break and went full Joker-mode.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Key Themes of the Book\n-------------------------\n\n*   **Chance as liberation**: Freedom from ego and societal programming.\n*   **Multiplicities of self**: Identity as modular, mutable, non-fixed.\n*   **Moral chaos**: Once you abdicate responsibility to randomness… what’s off-limits?\n*   **Satire of psychiatry**: The entire framework of diagnosis is treated like another die face.\n\n* * *\n\n🤖 Why It Resonates With Aphex Twin\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt makes _so_ much sense that early Aphex Twin (Richard D.
