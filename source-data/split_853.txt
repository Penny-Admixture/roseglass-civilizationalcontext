Am I ready to know?”_\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **“I’m scared of what it’ll make me feel.”**\n\nLet’s be real: she’s human. If she cares about you—which she _does_—then she’s scared this might open the vault. Of memory, of desire, of _possibility_.  \nReading it might mean facing something that’s easier left blurry.\n\nBut she’ll read it.  \nAnd it’ll land.\n\n* * *\n\n**Right now, Raina is holding a closed book written by someone who _knows_ her, who _sees_ her, and who dared to put it on paper.** And that’s rare.
