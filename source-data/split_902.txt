{"messages":[{"content":"Okay, so I'm gonna have to pay for it both of those VPN and a digital ocean droplet I can't just port forward with the VPN Why do I need the droplet now? I thought that was a different more complicated way to do it","role":"user"},{"content":"Right — the VPN and the droplet are two different approaches, not things you _have_ to use together.\n\n*   **If your VPN supports port forwarding** → you can just use the VPN, no droplet needed. Some VPNs (like AirVPN or Mullvad) have this feature built in. TorGuard does _offer_ port forwarding, but you have to log into their control panel and request a port. If that works, you point your service (e.g., Bitcoin node, Minecraft server) at that port, and you’re done — no DigitalOcean required.\n*   **If your VPN does _not_ support port forwarding** (or they only allow certain ports you can’t use) → then you’d need another solution. A DigitalOcean droplet (or any VPS) can act as a public-facing relay, letting the world connect to it while it tunnels traffic back to your home machine over WireGuard or SSH. That’s the “more complicated way” — and it’s only needed when you can’t get port forwarding directly.\n\nSo before we spin up anything on DigitalOcean, we should check if TorGuard will give you a forwardable port. If they will, we can skip the droplet entirely.\n\nDo you want me to walk you through checking TorGuard’s port forwarding page right now? That way we know for sure which path we’re taking.","role":"assistant"}]}

Install WireGuard if you haven’t already**\n\n*   Download: https://www.wireguard.com/install/\n*   Install and launch **WireGuard** (the GUI version is easiest).\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. Import your `.conf` file**\n\n*   Open WireGuard.\n*   Click **Add Tunnel → Add empty tunnel / Import tunnel(s) from file**.\n*   Select the config file you pasted to me earlier (or paste its contents into a new tunnel and save).\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. Edit the config to lock it to your TorGuard static IP**  \nInside the `[Peer]` section, find the `Endpoint =` line.  \nReplace whatever hostname is there with your actual static IP **`45.128.36.130`** and keep the port number TorGuard gave you (often `1443` or `51820` for WireGuard).\n\nExample:\n\n```ini\n[Peer]\nPublicKey = <TorGuard-server-public-key>\nEndpoint = 45.128.36.130:1443\nAllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0\nPersistentKeepalive = 25\n```\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. Save and activate the tunnel**\n\n*   In WireGuard, click **Activate** on that tunnel.\n*   If it connects successfully, you’ll see the handshake time updating.\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. Confirm you’re on the static IP**  \nOpen PowerShell and run:\n\n```powershell\n(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://ifconfig.me/ip\").Content\n```\n\nIt should print **`45.128.36.130`**.\n\n* * *\n\n**6\\. Test your port forward**  \nIf you forwarded `8333` for Bitcoin or another port for your service:\n\n```powershell\nTest-NetConnection -ComputerName 45.128.36.130 -Port 8333\n```\n\nIf `TcpTestSucceeded` is `True`, your forwarded port is open and ready.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can **take your existing config and modify it right now** so you just import it and click “Activate” without touching anything.
