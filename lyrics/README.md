# Lyrics Archive

## Purpose

This directory contains lyrics to songs that are culturally significant to Penny's personal archive and identity formation. These are preserved as part of the broader "data as compost" philosophy - capturing the cultural artifacts that shaped consciousness alongside the technical/philosophical content.
