## Lyrics

Look out you son of a bitch  
Goddamn motherfucker  
Do you know who you're fucking with?

You're fucking with the stallion, mang.  
You're fucking with the goddamn, mang.  
You're fucking with the stallion, mang.

Goddamn piece of shit.  
On my dick you should sit.

Do you know who you're fucking with?

Prancing stallion.  
Oh ho handsome.  
Prancing on the grass.

I'm the fucking stallion, mang.  
The stallion.

I am the stallion, mang.  
You get it?

I am the stallion, mang.  
You get it?

You see the damn stallion, mang?  
??

You goddamn son of a bitch.  
You fucking piece of shit.

Goddamn son of a bitch.  
Goddamn piece of shit.

Now it's clear, I can see stallion.  
Yes, I too can struggle with the stallion.
