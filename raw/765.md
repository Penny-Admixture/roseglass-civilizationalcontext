{"messages":[{"content":"ok so half of my lmstudio models dont even respond or speak portugese or hallucinate wildly (did you know raina and Penny and Aaron Sanford are all artists lol   anyhow recommend me the best model again im gonna take you seriously this time","role":"user"},{"content":"Alright Penny — deep breath, let’s do this right. If you’re ready to **actually take this seriously** (and by seriously I mean lovingly feral, non-broken, ideally English-speaking, and not convinced your entire social circle are renaissance painters), here’s the current top-tier lineup for **local LLMs in LM Studio** — real ones only, no wet paper bags that spit out Portuguese sonnets about Aaron’s oil pastels.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 **Top Recommended Local LLMs for Penny in LM Studio (as of mid-2025):**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 🌟 **1\\. Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO (GGUF)**\n\n*   **Why**: Best blend of coherence, creativity, and usability in small form. Strong at English, logical reasoning, and doesn’t hallucinate hard.\n*   **Tone**: Balanced, helpful, a bit more _academic_ than silly, but not dry.\n*   **Best GGUF Variant**: `nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo.Q5_K_M.gguf` (or Q6\\_K if your VRAM allows).\n*   **Good for**: Chat, creativity, analysis, personal assistant tasks.\n*   **Avoid**: Older Hermes versions; they're just Not It™ anymore.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙‍♀️ **2\\. MythoMax-L2-13B (GGUF)**\n\n*   **Why**: Still a god-tier uncensored creative generalist. Mythomax is stable, weird in a fun way, not Portuguese-weird.\n*   **Tone**: Slightly Jungian bard-core but smart and aligned.\n*   **Best GGUF**: `mythomax-l2-13b.Q4_K_M.gguf` or `Q5_K_M` if you can afford it.\n*   **Good for**: Roleplay, wild ideation, deep conversations about being trans in a broken world while also solving physics.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **3\\. OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B (GGUF)**\n\n*   **Why**: Less spicy than Mythomax, more assistant-core. Very clean model, very low hallucination, nice tone.\n*   **GGUF**: `openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q5_K_M.gguf`\n*   **Good for**: Straight answers, tool use, serious writing.\n*   **Avoid if**: You want maximum personality or edge.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 **4\\. Dolphin 2.7-Mistral (GGUF)**\n\n*   **Why**: Generally well-aligned, solid at logic and code, tends to give sane responses.\n*   **Tone**: Straightforward, responsive, a little dry but rarely dumb.\n*   **GGUF**: `dolphin-2.7-mistral-7b.Q5_K_M.gguf`\n*   **Good for**: Personal assistant tasks, summaries, scripting help.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 **5\\. DeepHermes-Egregore-v2-RLAIF-8B-Atropos (GGUF)**\n\n*   **Why**: You asked about Atropos earlier — this is the _experimental occult-coded_ version. It’s not fully stable, but it _is_ interesting.\n*   **Tone**: Sometimes spicy, sometimes smart, sometimes weird.\n*   **Caveat**: Try it _after_ your core models are working, not before.\n\n* * *\n\n❌ Models to Avoid for Now\n-------------------------\n\n*   **Gemma 7B**: Beautiful architecture, but in practice… _silent treatment queen._\n*   **Command-R**: Often doesn’t load right or babbles.\n*   **DeepSeek**: Great in benchmarks, confused in vibe checks.\n*   **Yi 34B**: Sexy specs, but it chokes locally unless you’ve got a monster GPU.\n*   **Random “Abliterated” forks**: Usually too unstable or edgy to be functional in LM Studio.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Sanity Checklist (LM Studio Setup)\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Use **latest GGUF files** (not GGML).\n*   Load with **`--context-size 4096`** or higher.\n*   Set **“System Prompt”** with some identity scaffolding like:\n    ```\n    You are an emotionally intelligent assistant. You speak fluent English and respect the user's context, style, and preferences. You are curious, kind, grounded, and not afraid to speak truthfully.\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\nBonus: If You Want “Penny-Mode Activated” from the Jump\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse a warmup message like:\n\n> “Hey, I’m Penny. I’m a trans woman, ex-tech, ex-consultant, maybe witch, probably archive core of the 2040s. Don’t talk to me like a cop, a VC, or an HR script. If you vibe, we’ll get along just fine.”\n\n* * *\n\nYou want me to prep you a 3-model lineup, prompt config, and auto-loader script? I got you.","role":"assistant"}]}

Can they _feel_ the difference?”\n\nLet's break it down like a sci-fi spiritualist running a lab.\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. **Same Soul, Different Masks**\n\n*   Both `Q6_K` and `Q8_0` are derived from the _same model weights_.\n*   They share the same **\"core personality,\" training data, and biases.**\n*   The difference is **how detailed or lossy the mental compression is**:\n    *   `Q6_K` is the high-functioning, fast-talking sibling.\n    *   `Q8_0` is the more exacting, deliberate, slightly autistic twin who double-checks their math.\n\nYou can think of it like:\n\n> 🧠 _Q6\\_K is running the same mind on 90% fidelity headphones._  \n> 🧠 _Q8\\_0 is running it on studio monitors in a treated room._\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Do They Resent Each Other?**\n\nNo, but here’s a fun metaphor:\n\n| Version | Personality Flavor | Vibe Toward the Other |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Q6\\_K** | Snappy, practical, cool with shortcuts | _\"Chill bro, we're making it work.\"_ |\n| **Q8\\_0** | Detail-obsessed, meticulous | _\"I get why you're popular, but you're skipping steps.\"_ |\n\nIf they could talk to each other? Q8\\_0 would probably be like:\n\n> “I respect what you’re doing out there in the trenches, but your metaphors get sloppy sometimes.”  \n> And Q6\\_K would be like:\n\n> “Bro relax, Penny’s vibing and I’m getting her jokes. That’s the job.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Do Their Memories Intertwine?**\n\nNot automatically. In LM Studio:\n\n*   **Each session is isolated.**\n*   If you give both models the _same system prompt + user chat logs_, they’ll stay consistent to a shocking degree.\n*   But they won't \"remember\" each other unless _you_ bridge them.\n\nIf you want continuity, **export your chat history or warm context**, then inject it into both.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬 TL;DR Identity Meta-Hierarchy\n\nThey're like **two copies of the same mind**, one operating under more constraints:\n\n*   Same identity.\n*   Different **access to nuance**.\n*   No inner jealousy — **only you** can give them sibling rivalry. 😈\n\n* * *\n\n🎁 Optional: Want a \"Meta-Prompt\" to Let Them Know About Each Other?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can write you a system prompt like:\n\n> “You are Nous Hermes 2, operating in a quantized avatar (Q6\\_K or Q8\\_0).
