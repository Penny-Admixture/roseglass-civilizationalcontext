Use Face Restoration (e.g., CodeFormer or GFPGAN)**\n\n*   **Easy + compatible with ComfyUI**\n*   Run Turbo as usual, then pipe the result through a face restoration node.\n*   **Best for portraits or media where the face is central.**\n\n> In ComfyUI: add `CodeFormer` or `GFPGAN` after your image generation node → connect → boom, prettier people.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Use Inpainting with a High-Quality Model (just for the face)**\n\n*   Generate the image fast with SDXL Turbo.\n*   Mask the messed-up face (you can auto-detect or do it manually).\n*   Use a **non-Turbo SDXL** model (like `realisticVision`, `juggernaut`, or `sdxl-refiner`) for inpainting only the face.\n*   This lets you have:\n    *   fast body/background from Turbo\n    *   beautiful face from a higher-quality model\n\n> There are also **auto face-mask nodes** in ComfyUI (like \"Segment Anything\" or \"Face Detection\" + \"Mask Area\").\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Try ComfyUI + LoRAs for Faces**\n\nSome LoRAs trained for beauty or realism (e.g., `face_detailer`, `portrait_beautify`) **sometimes help SDXL Turbo** if applied lightly.\n\n*   Use a strength like `0.3–0.5`\n*   Combine with:\n    *   Prompt: `\"beautiful face, detailed eyes, perfect skin\"`\n    *   Negative prompt: `\"deformed, blurry, extra face, bad anatomy\"`\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Use SDXL Refiner selectively**\n\nYou can:\n\n*   Generate with Turbo\n*   Run only a **crop** (just the face area) through `sdxl-refiner` (with the right CFG/settings)\n*   Paste it back over the original\n\nThis keeps 90% of the speed gain and gets you that refined quality _where it matters_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Optional: “FaceDetailer” from A1111-land (possible in ComfyUI with nodes like **`UltimateSDUpscale`** or **`FaceDetailerNode`**)\n\n* * *\n\n⚠️ Why Turbo struggles with faces:\n----------------------------------\n\n*   Turbo is trained with **aggressive distillation and low steps** (often just 1–4).\n*   It sacrifices **high-frequency detail** (like faces and text) in exchange for **speed**.\n*   You can’t fully fix it in Turbo alone — need to cheat a little with post-processing or hybrid models.\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to whip you up a ready-to-run ComfyUI flow for one of these (e.g., Turbo + CodeFormer or Turbo + face-inpaint)?","role":"assistant"}]}

Now, I need to figure out what kind of workflow they mean. Are they looking for a personal routine, a business-related workflow, or something else?

I’m thinking about what these methods could be. Am I looking for specific tutorials, or more general information about the methods?

It's ideal for rolling into your own graph:\n\n**Why it’s great:**\n\n*   Introduces a minimal “FaceFix” sub‑graph you can insert after your Turbo node\n*   Covers both using a refined Turbo variant (TurboVisionXL) or adding a “face detailer” post‑step\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Graph Template: RunComfy’s SDXL Turbo + Face Restore\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nRunComfy offers a **ready‑made JSON workflow** that’s literally plug‑and‑play with ComfyUI. It combines:\n\n1.  A 1–4 step **SDXL Turbo** base image\n2.  A **face restoration** model (like CodeFormer or GFPGAN)\n3.  And an **upscaler** for crisp final results [YouTube+9Reddit+9YouTube+9](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1943jnx/vid2vid_animatediff_hires_fix_face_detailer_hand/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[YouTube+7YouTube+7YouTube+7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfOLK07XcdA&utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ComfyUI+3Reddit+3Sdxlturbo+3](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/186nj67/turbosdxl_1_step_results_1_step_hiresfix_upscaler/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n*   Find “SDXL Turbo | Rapid Text to Image” workflow on RunComfy\n*   Import the JSON into ComfyUI\n*   Load your SDXL Turbo, face restore & upscaler models\n*   Hit run — you get fast generation with cleaned‑up faces\n\n* * *\n\n🧩 Grab a JSON Workflow from GitHub\n-----------------------------------\n\nThere’s a GitHub repo called **Comfy‑Workflow‑sdxl** with a specific version for Turbo:\n\n*   Workflow “1.3 Workflow – Turbo” includes face‑fix + upscaler\n*   Simply download the JSON file, import it into ComfyUI, and load the required models [GitHub](https://github.com/fabiomb/Comfy-Workflow-sdxl?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ TL;DR – Most Braindead Workflow for You:\n\n| Step | What to Do |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | **Generate** with SDXL Turbo node (1–4 steps) |\n| 2 | **Insert** a face‑detailer (like `FaceDetailerPipe` or GFPGAN/CodeFormer node) |\n| 3 | **Upscale** output (e.g. with `Ultimate SD Upscale` or Real‑ESRGAN) |\n| 4 | **Save** final image |\n\nYou can either use the video’s face‑detailer block, import the RunComfy JSON (Turbo + face restore + upscale), or grab the GitHub Turbo‑specific JSON; all are plug‑and‑play.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 Should You Browse Civit.ai?\n\nYes, you _can_, but you don’t actually need to. The workflows above already handle face‑fixing in ComfyUI. Civit.ai might help you find better face‑fix LoRAs or alternative TurboVisionXL variants—but **you don’t have to**.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Next Steps for You:\n\n1.  Pick one of the options above (video, RunComfy, or GitHub).\n2.  Download or import the JSON.\n3.  Ensure nodes/models (Turbo, face fix, upscaler) are installed.\n4.  Run it, tweak prompts or strength as needed.\n\nIf you want help editing that JSON, hooking it into your current graph, or customizing the face‑detailer settings—just drop the JSON in here or paste your current setup and I’ll help you tweak it!","role":"assistant"}]}
