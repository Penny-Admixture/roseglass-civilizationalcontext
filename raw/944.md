Secondly, Docker on Windows just insists that you use Windows subsystem for Linux or something if you want to have GPU support. What the fuck, dude?\n\nInstalling Whishper\nAVX\n\nIf your system is not compatible with AVX, such as Synology NAS and others, read the AVX problems page and follow the instructions there.\n\nDocker Pulls\n\nInstalling Whishper is easy. You can install it on your own machine, in a few simple steps.\n\nRequirements\nHardware requirements\nDocker\nWhishper is a collection of servicess, so the easiest way to run it is by using Docker. You can find instructions on how to install Docker on your machine on the official Docker documentation.\nYou can also run the official docker script to install Docker on your machine:\n\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh\nQuick Install\nThe whishper repo contains a useful bash script that will install Whishper for you.\n\nLinux / macOS\n🔥 GPU Support\n\nIf you want to use a GPU, take a read at the GPU support page before running the script.\n\nYou can run it with the following command:\n\n# Get the script\ncurl -fsSL -o get-whishper.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/whishper/main/get-whishper.sh\n# Run it\nbash get-whishper.sh\nJust follow the steps, to get it setup with Docker. After the script finishes, you will be able to access Whishper at http://localhost:8082.\n\nNote\n\nIf you want to use a custom domain, you can follow the reverse proxy guide. For a full HTTPS setup guide, with either custom or local domain, check out the HTTPS guide.\n\nWindows\nDownload the installation bat script from the repo:\n\n# Get the script\ncurl -fsSL -o get-whishper.ps1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/whishper/main/get-whishper.bat\nOnce you have the script, make sure you have Docker installed and running, and then run the script.\n\nJust follow the steps, to get it setup with Docker. After the script finishes, you will be able to access Whishper at http://localhost:8082.\n\nManual Install\n🔥 GPU Support\n\nIf you want to use a GPU, take a read at the GPU support page before continuing.\n\nTo install Whishper, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the necessary files from the repository:\n curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/whishper/main/docker-compose.yml && \\\n curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/whishper/main/example.env && \\\n curl -o nginx.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluja/whishper/main/nginx.conf\n2. Edit the .env file to your liking. Check out the configuration page for more information.\n3. Create directories needed for libretranslate and give these the right permissions:\nThis step is needed because libretranslate runs as a non-root user inside the container, and it needs to write to this folder so it can store the translation models.\n\nmkdir -p ./whishper_data/libretranslate/{data,cache} && \\\nchown -R 1032:1032 whishper_data/libretranslate\nmacOS users\n\nsome macOS users reported that they don’t need to set the permissions (chown), if you face problems, try to just leave it as it is after creating the directories.\n\n4. Pull the images and start the containers:\ndocker compose up -d\nCaution\n\nThe first startup of the containers can take a while, depending on your internet connection, since it will donwload all the models for transcription and translation. This will only happen on the first run, since the models will be stored in the whishper_data directory.\n\nWait around 2 or 5 minutes, for everything to get ready. You can check the logs with docker compose logs -f to see the progress.\n\nDone! You can now access Whishper at http://localhost:8082.\nNote\n\nIf you want to use a custom domain, you can follow the reverse proxy guide.

Install WSL2\n    2.  Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend\n    3.  Use NVIDIA’s `nvidia-container-toolkit` inside the Linux side\n*   If you don’t do that, Docker on Windows only sees CPU.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3️⃣ Your actual options**\n\nIf you hate this whole chain, you’ve got three escape routes:\n\n#### **Option A — Bare‑metal Linux**\n\n*   Ditch Windows for GPU workloads. Install Ubuntu/Debian and run Whishper with Docker or without it.\n*   GPU works natively, no WSL shenanigans. Fastest, cleanest option.\n\n#### **Option B — Native Windows install (no Docker)**\n\n*   Skip Docker entirely, clone the repo, install Python + dependencies manually.\n*   Install `ffmpeg` and `whisper` locally, then run Whishper’s services directly on Windows.\n*   You lose the one‑click Docker setup, but you _do_ keep GPU without WSL.\n\n#### **Option C — Keep Docker, but run it inside Linux VM**\n\n*   Use something like **Proxmox** or **VMWare Workstation** with GPU passthrough to a Linux VM.\n*   Install Docker in the VM. Same effect as WSL2, but without Microsoft in the loop.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **step‑by‑step “no Docker” Windows install for Whishper** so it uses your GPU directly.  \nThat would completely dodge this WSL2+Docker mess.\n\nDo you want me to put that together?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"id love to do it no docker is it possible even?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, it’s absolutely possible — but the reason they’re yelling “Docker” in the docs is because they’ve bundled multiple moving parts into a single container stack (Whisper, LibreTranslate, Nginx, maybe a DB).\n\nIf we rip Docker out, you can still run Whishper **directly** on Windows with GPU — but you’ll need to:\n\n1.  **Manually install the dependencies** (Python packages, translation models, maybe Redis or similar if they use it).\n2.  **Run each service as a native process** instead of in a container.\n3.  Adjust a couple config files so they point to the right folders on Windows.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠 How we’d do a **No‑Docker Whishper GPU install** on Windows\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1️⃣ Install Python & Git\n\n*   Install **Python 3.10+** (check `python --version`)\n*   Install **Git** if you don’t have it\n\n* * *\n\n### 2️⃣ Clone the repo\n\n```powershell\ngit clone https://github.com/pluja/whishper.git\ncd whishper\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 3️⃣ Create & activate venv\n\n```powershell\npython -m venv venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 4️⃣ Install requirements\n\n```powershell\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThis will pull in **OpenAI Whisper** + **LibreTranslate** + whatever else they need.  \nIf `requirements.txt` only covers part of it, we can just manually `pip install` the missing ones.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5️⃣ Install ffmpeg (needed for audio)\n\nEasiest way on Windows:\n\n```powershell\nwinget install Gyan.FFmpeg\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 6️⃣ Enable GPU for Whisper\n\nWhisper runs on **PyTorch**. Install the GPU build:\n\n```powershell\npip uninstall torch torchaudio torchvision -y\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\n```\n\n(Change `cu121` to match your NVIDIA driver’s CUDA version.)\n\n* * *\n\n### 7️⃣ Deal with LibreTranslate\n\nLibreTranslate is normally run in its own container, but it’s also just a Python app.  \nYou can install it like:\n\n```powershell\npip install libretranslate\n```\n\nThen start it:\n\n```powershell\nlibretranslate --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000\n```\n\nWe’ll point Whishper at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in its `.env`.\n\n* * *\n\n### 8️⃣ Configure Whishper\n\n*   Copy `example.env` to `.env`\n*   Edit it to:\n    *   Set LibreTranslate URL to your local one\n    *   Set paths for any models\n    *   Change ports if needed\n\n* * *\n\n### 9️⃣ Run Whishper directly\n\nIf it’s a single service:\n\n```powershell\npython app.py\n```\n\nIf they split it into multiple microservices, we’ll run each one in its own terminal tab (or use something like `foreman`).\n\n* * *\n\n💡 **Result:**  \nYou get Whishper running on Windows, directly on your GPU, **no Docker, no WSL2**, and faster startup since you’re not pulling images.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can **pull the actual repo, crack open their `docker-compose.yml`**, and translate the container setup into a native Windows run sequence for you.  \nThat way we’re not guessing dependencies — we’ll know _exactly_ what to run.\n\nWant me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}
