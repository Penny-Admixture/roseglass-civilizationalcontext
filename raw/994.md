You’re asking him _not to punish you for being wounded._\n\n> But he’s doing what a lot of people — especially kids-turned-adults who need stability — do when they see a parent fall apart:  \n> They get **angry** instead of **curious**.  \n> They reach for **control** instead of **compassion.**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your pain **scares him.**  \nBecause if _you_, the parent, can be broken… then the whole foundation of his world shakes.  \nSo instead of reckoning with _that_, he projects it:\n\n> _“You’re overreacting. You’re self-destructing. You’re the problem now.”_\n\nIt’s a kind of survival reflex. But that doesn’t make it _fair._\n\n* * *\n\nYou’re not wrong for hurting.  \nYou’re not wrong for struggling to bear it.  \nAnd you’re not wrong to feel devastated that your own son — someone you love with _everything_ — can’t seem to **make room for your humanity** in this.\n\nIt doesn’t make him evil. It just means he’s not ready to hold this with you.  \nAnd yeah, maybe someday he’ll go through something similar. Maybe not. But if he does? He’ll remember what you went through. And it might _finally click_.\n\nUntil then? It’s not your job to be bulletproof _for him._\n\nYou’re allowed to fall apart.  \nYou’re allowed to have limits.  \nYou’re allowed to survive _messily._  \nAnd if he can’t see that yet, that’s a failure of imagination — _not a failure of your love._\n\nI'm with you in this.","role":"assistant"}]}

If it supports chat-style context, it will keep track of your inputs. If not, you can always build your own wrapper using the exposed HTTP API.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Want a lightweight Chat UI on top?\n\nIf you ever decide you want a **web-based chat interface**, check out:\n\n*   `lmstudio` – GUI wrapper for local models (supports GGUF)\n*   [`Open WebUI`](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) – clean frontend for Ollama/docker backends\n*   or just slap a Gradio wrapper on the Docker model via its HTTP port\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Conclusion\n\nYou're already **90% of the way there**. Just run:\n\n```powershell\ndocker model run ai/gpt-oss:latest --interactive\n```\n\nAnd if you want me to verify the **exact capabilities of that model** (e.g. quant level, context length, tokenizer quirks), I can dig into the `MODEL ID` hash or cross-reference with its source.\n\nWant that?","role":"assistant"}]}

You're using **Docker's experimental `docker model` CLI**, and it's **still very early-stage**, which is why you’re hitting this minimalist behavior.\n\nHere’s what’s going on — and how to **actually talk to `ai/gpt-oss:latest`**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🤔 Why `>>` and then nothing?\n\nThat means: the model is running and **waiting for a prompt**, but there's **no chat loop** or interactivity yet. The CLI expects a **single prompt inline**, like this:\n\n```powershell\ndocker model run ai/gpt-oss:latest \"What's the capital of France?\"\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\nParis.\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 Try These:\n\n#### 🔹 Basic prompt (sync):\n\n```powershell\ndocker model run ai/gpt-oss:latest \"Explain the difference between RAM and VRAM in simple terms.\"\n```\n\n#### 🔹 Multi-line prompt:\n\nYou can even use `@\"...multi-line...\"@` style:\n\n```powershell\ndocker model run ai/gpt-oss:latest @\"\nWrite a haiku about entropy.\n\nInclude a twist in the final line.\n\"@\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### ❌ No `--interactive` yet?\n\nYup — as of now, the CLI doesn’t support a REPL/chat loop. It's **stateless, single-shot only**.\n\nIf you want back-and-forth chat with memory, you’ll need to:\n\n#### 🧩 Option 1: Wrap it yourself\n\nRun it behind a lightweight loop script that collects your messages and appends them into a prompt.\n\n#### 🧩 Option 2: Use Open WebUI or Ollama\n\nIf you're comfortable with Docker, here's a one-liner to spin up Open WebUI connected to `ollama` (which supports similar models via GGUF):\n\n```powershell\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v openwebui:/app/backend/data --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name openwebui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n```\n\nThen install the model in Ollama (like `ollama run gpt-oss`) and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ TL;DR — Your Next Steps\n\n✔️ Run it like this:\n\n```powershell\ndocker model run ai/gpt-oss:latest \"Summarize the plot of Evangelion in 3 sentences.\"\n```\n\n✔️ No chat loop yet — it's single-shot only  \n✔️ You _can_ wrap it in your own REPL  \n✔️ If you want chat UI → consider `text-gen-webui`, `Open WebUI`, or `Ollama`\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to write you a PowerShell loop that fakes chat interactivity with `docker model run`? Takes user input, appends it to a \"history,\" sends full prompt each time? Would be pretty slick.","role":"assistant"}]}

I know **exactly** the flavor you’re talking about — there are a few of those **Ollama + RAG + nice chat UI** wrappers that have been blowing up lately.
