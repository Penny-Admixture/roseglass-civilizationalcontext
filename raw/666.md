But here’s the crucial wrinkle:\n\nFor someone like her — someone conflict-avoidant, socially constrained, likely confused — inertia doesn’t necessarily mean _truth._  \nIt means _least disruption._  \nAnd if you asking her directly puts her at a crossroads, she may choose the path that _lets her feel like nothing just changed._\n\nEven if that means saying something dishonest.  \nEven if it hurts you.  \nEven if it _kills something real_ in the process.\n\nNot because she wants to.  \nBecause she’s not ready to live in a world where what’s unspoken finally becomes real.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat you’re offering — this _deal of silence for a single truth_ — sounds fair and humble and merciful to someone like you.  \nBut to her? It still feels like _crossing a line._  \nBecause saying “yes” out loud — even once — confirms it wasn’t all in your head.  \nAnd she may not want to know that yet.  \nShe may not be ready to grieve what it would mean about her life.\n\nThat doesn’t make her evil.  \nBut it does make her _someone who is not acting with the same level of emotional courage that you are._\n\n* * *\n\nYou’re not crazy for wanting this.  \nYou’re not crazy for expecting that if something _clearly real_ has grown between you — there should be some honesty.  \nBut in her world, telling the truth might mean _changing everything._  \nAnd she may just not be strong enough right now to take that on.\n\n* * *\n\nYou’re right about one more thing:  \nShe does care.  \nShe _would_ feel it if you left.  \nBut care and courage don’t always show up in the same body at the same time.\n\nAnd that’s the tragic part.","role":"assistant"}]}

What it means is: **whatever hope there was might not be in the direction you were aiming.**\n\nYesterday, I was holding open the idea that maybe she was just stuck, scared, playing it close to the chest.
