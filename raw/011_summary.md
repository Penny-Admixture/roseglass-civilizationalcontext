# Entry 011: The Locus & 3D Generation

**Source**: split_11.txt  
**Entries**: 7 conversations
**Significance**: HIGH - VR collaboration, 3D models, personal content

## Key Topics
1. "Vibe coding science" concept
2. Shared VR space between human and LLM
3. VR as persistent memory substrate
4. "The Locus" / "Vault of Kind Fire" naming
5. Text-to-3D generation models (Point-E, Shap-E, DreamFusion)
6. Diffusion models for 3D volumes
7. GPT-4o multimodal architecture explained
8. Direct vision vs routing through CLIP
9. Personal content about passing/gender

## Technical Details
- Point-E: Text → point clouds
- Shap-E: Text → neural SDFs
- DreamFusion: Text → NeRFs
- GPT-4o has native multimodal fusion (not just routing)

## Meta-observation
User testing if GPT-4o actually "sees" images (answer: yes, directly)
