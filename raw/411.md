{"messages":[{"content":"So the first thing to do would be install Visual Studio 2022, I guess, again.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — that's absolutely the move. Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition is free, stable, fast, and will feel like slipping back into your old boots… only now they’ve got async debugging and hot reload.\n\nHere’s exactly what I recommend to get rolling cleanly:\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ **Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition) with the right workloads**\n\n1.  Download:  \n    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/\n2.  During install, select these workloads:\n    *   **.NET Desktop Development** ← _Essential for WinForms / WPF / GDI+ drawing_\n    *   **Universal Windows Platform development** _(optional, only if you want UWP features)_\n    *   _(Optional)_ **Game development with C++** if you later want interop or multimedia libs\n    *   _(Optional)_ **.NET MAUI** for cross-platform, but don’t worry about that yet\n3.  After install, do this once:\n    *   Launch VS2022\n    *   Sign in (optional, but lets you sync settings / use GitHub)\n    *   Tools → Options → Projects and Solutions → \"Always show solution\" → ✅ _(so you don’t get weird single-file-mode behavior)_\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ Create your project\n\n*   **File → New → Project**\n    *   Choose: `Windows Forms App (.NET)`\n    *   Target framework: **.NET 6 or .NET 8** (modern, LTS, high-perf)\n    *   Name it: `HauntedPaint` or `GlitchCanvas` or `FillHell` or whatever you vibe with\n\nBoom — you’re now sitting in front of `Form1.cs`, and you can literally do:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)\n{\n    using var brush = new SolidBrush(Color.HotPink);\n    e.Graphics.FillEllipse(brush, 100, 100, 50, 50);\n}\n```\n\n…and now you have an ellipse. An entire ellipse. With no “scenes.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙 Bonus Tips\n\n*   If you want to draw manually anytime, override `OnPaint` or call `this.Invalidate()` after `MouseMove`, etc.\n*   For tiling fill patterns, you can use `TextureBrush`:\n    ```csharp\n    Image img = Image.FromFile(\"tile.png\");\n    using var brush = new TextureBrush(img);\n    e.Graphics.FillRectangle(brush, new Rectangle(0, 0, Width, Height));\n    ```\n*   For pixel sorting, glitching, and other manipulation — lock the bitmap with `LockBits`, do unsafe pointer math (or use Span<T>), then unlock. Fast as hell.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know when it’s installed — I’ll give you a ready-to-run file browser + canvas app skeleton in one go, zero fluff, pure pennycore.","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"So question, I am like very short on space on my C drive. Is there a way to force a lot of the components to install on my drive that I have a ton of space on? Because like C is fucking spoken for right now. And that's where the reason I keep uninstalling Visual Studio is because it's fucking huge. Ish.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes, 100%. Visual Studio’s installer **does support changing the installation path**, but it’s **a bit of a trap** unless done _carefully_ — because **some stuff will still go on C:** no matter what. But we can minimize that.\n\nHere’s how to do it sanely:\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ **How to install Visual Studio 2022 to a non-C drive**\n\n1.  **Run the Visual Studio Installer**, or re-launch it if already installed.\n    Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visualstudio/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17\n2.  **Click \"More → Install locations\"** in the bottom-right corner of the installer screen **before installing**.\n3.  You'll see:\n    *   **Installation location**\n        *   This is where the _main program files_ go.\n        *   Change this to something like:\n            ```\n            D:\\Apps\\VisualStudio2022\n            ```\n    *   **Download cache location**\n        *   Change this to:\n            ```\n            D:\\VSCache\n            ```\n        (This is ~35+ GB during install. Huge win to move it.)\n4.  Click **OK**, then proceed to select workloads (e.g., .NET Desktop, etc.).\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚠️ What Still Gets Installed to C:\\\\ Anyway\n\nEven if you move the install base, VS _insists_ on putting some crap in:\n\n*   `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\Packages`\n*   `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer`\n*   `C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio`\n*   `C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio`\n*   A bunch of other SDK & MSBuild bits\n\nYou **can’t fully avoid this**, but you can **symlink** them if you're desperate. I can give you a PowerShell script to relocate & rewire them if needed.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💣 If You Want to Go Nuclear\n\nIf your C:\\\\ drive is absolutely starved, let me know and I’ll prep a script to:\n\n*   Move `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio` to another drive\n*   Move `.nuget` packages off C\n*   Symlink the insane `ProgramData\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\Packages` folder\n\nBut that’s a bit spicy, and only worth it if you’re down to like 1–2 GB free.\n\n* * *\n\nWant the symlink PowerShell script too, or just start with the cleaner installer location?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"So, I think one thing might be to, like, I have a second user account that I don't necessarily need, but, like, I have no idea what all is hidden in it. It could be things that are, like, irreplaceable. Is there a way to, like, copy all the information associated with an account to an external drive and then delete it? So, if later I need to get a specific file or something out of there, I can.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes — you can absolutely back up a full user profile to another drive **before deleting the account**, and still retrieve anything from it later. It’s smart to do it this way, especially if there might be irreplaceable data in `%AppData%`, downloads, or hidden folders.\n\nHere’s how to do a **complete export of a user account**, the safe way:\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Step-by-Step: Backup and Delete a Windows User Profile Safely\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 🔹 Step 1: Locate the Profile Folder\n\nUser profiles live here:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\<Username>\n```\n\nYou’ll want to back up the entire folder, including:\n\n*   `Desktop`\n*   `Documents`\n*   `Downloads`\n*   `Pictures`\n*   `AppData` (hidden, but important — contains app settings, caches, configs, saved sessions, etc.)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔹 Step 2: Use PowerShell to Back It Up\n\n**Replace `olduser` with the actual account name**, and `E:\\Backups\\Users` with your desired external or secondary drive path.\n\n```powershell\n$source = \"C:\\Users\\olduser\"\n$destination = \"E:\\Backups\\Users\\olduser\"\n\n# Create the backup folder\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destination -Force\n\n# Copy everything, including hidden and system files\nRobocopy $source $destination /MIR /XJ /COPYALL /R:2 /W:2 /Z /V /ETA /NFL /NDL\n```\n\n> 🟡 This uses `Robocopy` with `/MIR` (mirror), `/COPYALL` (everything incl. ACLs), `/XJ` (no junction loops). It’s safe and thorough.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔹 Step 3: (Optional) Confirm the Backup\n\nAfter copying, you can check it with something like:\n\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -Path \"E:\\Backups\\Users\\olduser\" | Measure-Object\n```\n\nThat’ll tell you number of files and folders — just compare it to a similar command on the original folder.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔹 Step 4: Delete the Account _Without Deleting Files Automatically_\n\nWhen ready, go to:\n\n```\nControl Panel > User Accounts > Manage another account\n```\n\n1.  Select the account\n2.  Choose **“Delete the account”**\n3.  Pick **“Delete files”** only if you’ve confirmed your backup. Otherwise choose **“Keep files”** to move them to your desktop (but this only keeps standard folders, not full AppData etc).\n\nAlternatively, you can use PowerShell to remove the account more precisely (tell me if you want this route — it avoids surprises).\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔹 Bonus: Later File Recovery\n\nOnce backed up, you can browse or copy out individual files whenever needed. Just remember some things might be under:\n\n*   `E:\\Backups\\Users\\olduser\\AppData\\Roaming\\...`\n*   or `...AppData\\Local\\...`\n\nYou can also load the registry hive later (`NTUSER.DAT`) if needed for deep recovery (e.g. saved software keys, app states, etc.)\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to prepare a PowerShell function to automate all of this in one step with safety checks?","role":"assistant"}]}

I'm an administrator in this account, can I just run it from here?","role":"user"},{"content":"Nope — you do **not** need to log into the `development` account to back it up. In fact, it's **better that you don’t**, because:\n\n> 🔒 If you're logged into an account, many files (especially in `AppData`) will be locked and skipped by backup tools.\n\nSince you're already an administrator in your current account, you can run the whole operation from here — just make sure PowerShell is **run as administrator**.\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Full Command to Back Up `development` User Account\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming you want to store the backup on `D:`:\n\n```powershell\n$source = \"C:\\Users\\development\"\n$destination = \"D:\\Backups\\Users\\development\"\n\n# Create the backup directory (adjust as needed)\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destination -Force\n\n# Do the backup with Robocopy (safe, full copy including permissions and hidden files)\nRobocopy $source $destination /MIR /XJ /COPYALL /R:2 /W:2 /Z /V /ETA /NFL /NDL\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 📌 Notes:\n\n*   `Run PowerShell as Administrator`: Right-click PowerShell and choose **\"Run as administrator\"**\n*   `Robocopy` is safe and will retry any locked files up to 2 times (`/R:2`)\n*   The `/XJ` flag avoids issues with junctions (symlink loops)\n*   The `AppData` folder will be fully copied since you’re not logged into `development`\n\nOnce that’s done, you can delete the account safely via Control Panel or PowerShell. Let me know if you want to do the deletion via script too — I can give you the cleanest version.\n\nReady to run the backup?","role":"assistant"}]}
