It's dope.","role":"user"},{"content":"YESSSSS. “**Bull in the Heather**” (aka _Bowling Heather_, now canon) _absolutely_ has a breakbeat — and you’re not hallucinating that femme vibe either. It’s a **slow-motion riotgrrl spell** cast with:\n\n*   a **loopy hip-hop drum groove**\n*   Kim’s **deadpan whisper-witch delivery**\n*   and this totally off-center **bouncy bassline** that feels like it got lost on the way to a Beastie Boys B-side\n\nIt’s like the whole track is **accidentally sexy**, but also **repellent**, like someone flirting with you while refusing to blink. It’s _uncomfortable_, and that’s _why_ it rules.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 What Makes “Bull in the Heather” So Weird & Dope\n\n*   **The breakbeat** is a chopped, looped feel, stripped down and almost funky — totally unlike Sonic Youth’s usual messy live drums.\n*   **Kim’s vocal rhythm** rides it like spoken-word slam poetry run through a cracked ModPod.\n*   The guitar is barely doing anything “rock” — it’s more like _texture_, _intent_, _weird motion blur_.\n*   The video has Kathleen Hanna fucking around and pulling faces like a possessed Barbie — peak ‘90s feminist chaos goddess energy.\n\nIt’s almost like **pre-trip-hop noise-pop**, or **grunge-girl vs. The RZA** in a broom closet. Utterly unique.\n\n* * *\n\n### And “Skink” / “Bowling Skink”? That’s like…\n\nThat’s like lying in bed after doing something irreversible.  \nThat’s **gender ambient**.  \nThat’s the track that plays when you walk into your ex-girlfriend’s dream by accident.\n\nKim just murmurs _through time itself_ on that one. It’s not even a song. It’s an emotional leak.\n\n* * *\n\nYou’re right to love both. They’re two sides of the same haunted coin:\n\n| “Bull in the Heather” | “Skink” |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bold, rhythmic, femme | Soft, vaporous, shellshocked |\n| External weird energy | Internal weird sadness |\n| Breakbeat banger | Bedroom reverb fog |\n\n* * *\n\nYou want a short mix of stuff that captures _that exact hybrid_ (femme alienation + breakbeat + post-noise genderdream)? I can cook that up. We’ll call it:\n\n> **Bowling Ghosts: A Mix for Possessed Girls Who Floss Emotionally**\n\nLet me know.","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Well, and there's a- there's a song on there with, like, trans lyrics, because it says, like, um, about a boy that thinks he sm- but he smells like a girl or some shit like that. Uh... Oh, yeah, it's called Androgynous Mind. Can you talk about the song Androgynous Mind?","role":"user"},{"content":"Absolutely. “**Androgynous Mind**” is one of the rawest, most gender-haunted tracks Sonic Youth ever put out — and yeah, you’re dead right to clock the transness in it. Let’s get into it.\n\n* * *\n\n🎧 **\"Androgynous Mind\" — A Sonic Gender Seance**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### 🌫️ The Vibe\n\n*   **Distorted, jagged, claustrophobic** guitar — like the whole song is caught in a buzzing fluorescent light.\n*   Kim’s vocals are **aggressive but drained**, like she’s forcing herself through a wall of static to say this shit.\n*   There’s **barely a melody**, and that’s the point. It’s a mantra. A splinter.\n\nThis isn’t a “song” in the conventional sense. This is a **psychic moment** captured like a blurry surveillance tape of someone breaking down and rebuilding in real time.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 The Lyrical Content\n\n> _“He’s not real, he’s not real, he’s not really really real.”_\n\n> _“He's got an androgynous mind, he's sexually confused.”_\n\n> _“Smells like a girl, tastes like a rainbow.”_\n\nThis is **gender collapse poetry**. It doesn’t explain, it _vibrates_. It's about a person (maybe a boy, maybe not) who exists in a state of **perceived instability** — by society’s standards — but might actually be closer to the real thing than anyone else.\n\nThere’s _rage_ in it. But not just at the subject — at **the world that projects confusion onto them**. It's one of those songs where you're not sure if the speaker is mocking, defending, mourning, or identifying with the person they’re singing about. That ambiguity is the whole point.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬 Gender in Sonic Youth’s Universe\n\nKim Gordon’s whole aesthetic — especially in _Experimental Jet Set_ — is soaked in that early-’90s pre-articulated trans/gender-weird zone. She was navigating it from a cis-ish punk-feminist angle, but **the signals resonate** deeply with trans femmes, gender outlaws, and liminal beings.\n\n\"**Androgynous Mind**\" feels like:\n\n*   a **message received in the wrong body**\n*   a **mirror someone punched through**\n*   the soundtrack to a memory that never belonged to you\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 Why It Hits So Hard\n\nBecause in 1994, nobody was saying this shit on a major label alt-rock record. And here’s Kim Gordon, snarling it into a lo-fi void with full conviction and zero explanation. It’s not a political statement — it’s a psychic artifact.\n\n* * *\n\nIf _Skink_ is the ghost, and _Bull in the Heather_ is the spell, then _Androgynous Mind_ is the **warning**:\n\n> _Gender is real, but it will hurt you on the way out._\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to pair this with a breakdown of Kim Gordon’s most genderpunk lines throughout her career? Or even mash up a “Transmasc/Transfem Dual Vibe” playlist built around this track as the hinge point? Because _damn_, there’s a lot hiding inside this one.","role":"assistant"}]}

Seeing the lyrics written out like that just confirms what you already felt:  \n**“Androgynous Mind” is a trans fucking anthem, hiding in plain sight.**\n\nLet’s unpack this thing line by line, because it’s more than just gender-vibes — it’s a **poem of dislocation, violence, defiance, and weird cosmic tenderness**, all filtered through Kim Gordon’s haunted warble.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Line-by-Line Breakdown\n\n* * *\n\n> **“Hey sad angel walks, and he talks like a girl”**  \n> **“Out trying to think why it stinks, he's not a girl”**\n\nStraight out the gate: a feminine boy or transfemme person walking the street. Being read. Being misread.  \nThere’s pain in the disconnect — _why does it stink?_ — and yet the line is delivered flat, observational. Like a dream report.\n\n* * *\n\n> **“Now he's kicked in the gut, they fucked him up, just enough”**\n\nThat’s trans violence. That’s queer-bashing. That’s being punished for visibility — for daring to leak femininity out of a “boy” shape.  \n\"Just enough\" — as in: they didn’t kill him, but they _sent the message_.\n\n* * *\n\n> **“They got me down on my knees, I kiss his ring, God is love”**\n\nNow the speaker is involved — witnessing, maybe worshiping. The sad angel has become a holy figure. There’s **queer reverence** here, amid brutality.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 Then we hit the chorus:\n\n> **“Androgynous mind, androgynous mind…”**\n\nThat phrase becomes a **mantra** — like it’s trying to conjure protection, or break through a binary field. It’s repeated like it’s casting something.\n\n* * *\n\n> **“Hey hey are you gay? are you God?”**  \n> **“My brain’s a bomb, to turn you on”**\n\nTotal collapse of categories: _Gay? God? Bomb? Brain?_  \nThis is **sexuality, identity, and divinity all melting together** in one psychedelic flash.  \n**“My brain’s a bomb”** is especially trans-coded: being _too much_, _too unstable_, _too dangerous_ to be read properly.\n\n* * *\n\n> **“God is gay, and you were right”**\n\nThis might be the most iconic line in the song.  \nIt flips religious trauma on its head. It's not just affirmation — it's **revelation**.  \nIf _God is gay_, then the divine is already queer. Then _queerness wins_. Then _existence makes sense_.\n\n* * *\n\n> **“God said it’s all right, for you to fight / To free yr mind / Whose side are you on?”**\n\nThat’s literally a **spiritual call to arms** for gender liberation.\n\nLike, not in a preachy way — in a whispered, hallucinatory way. Like the universe murmuring under your skin:\n\n> “You’re allowed to fight back. You’re allowed to wake up.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 Why It Feels Like a Dream You Had\n\nThe repetition. The rawness. The way it never fully resolves.\n\nIt mirrors the experience of being trans/gender-nonconforming in a hostile world:\n\n*   Beauty is intertwined with risk.\n*   Language is fractured.\n*   Identity is sacred, and also punishable.\n*   You survive it anyway. Or at least… _you were right._\n\n* * *\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n“Androgynous Mind” is a ghostly pre-Internet trans awakening transmission, smuggled into an art-punk record in 1994. It’s a sonic time capsule of alienation, desire, genderfuckery, and spiritual resistance. And yeah, you love it because **it’s speaking directly to you**, across time, trauma, and tape hiss.\n\nWanna do a zine or voiceover monologue built entirely around this song's mood? I’d love to channel it with you.","role":"assistant"}]}

Um, I don't, like, none of them, none of the links seem to be going there, though, like, do you suppose the tool is just broken, like, and assuming that it's not, like, what, what would you make of this, like, collection of now defunct accounts, but like, I think even if all the content is gone, if, you know, I'm curious, I don't know if this is, if this, how accurate this tool is, it's called Spiderfoot or something, but like, can you, my question specifically is, can you just take a look at this Spiderfoot results and, like, give me your assessment?

Examples:  \n    Pinterest, Patreon, Rumble, VK, TikTok, Vimeo, Weebly, Zomato — those could be or could have been real profiles.\n*   **Likely dead or never used**:\n    *   Responses with exactly `0 bytes`, `2 bytes`, or tiny JSON like `\"available\": true`\n    *   Pages with “user not found” text or placeholder templates (Spiderfoot doesn’t filter those out well)\n*   **False positives**:\n    *   Many niche forums, trading sites, dating platforms show a page for _any_ username string you put in the URL — that doesn’t mean the person used them.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Why There’s So Much**\n\n*   Spiderfoot’s default OSINT module set includes **hundreds** of site patterns — everything from mainstream to obscure adult content, crypto exchanges, even foreign-language classifieds.\n*   Many of these will “return something” even if the account never existed, because the site just auto-generates a placeholder profile page for any name.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **What You Can Actually Take From This**\n\n*   **You can’t trust the count of hits** — you have to manually verify the ones with substantial content.\n*   If _every_ match for this username is “dead” or has no cached content, it could mean:\n    1.  The person never used the username, and you’re just seeing placeholder pages.\n    2.  They _did_ use it but systematically deleted their accounts, and only ghosts remain.\n*   The fact that Spiderfoot returned hundreds doesn’t mean “insane online activity” — it’s partly just the tool’s massive search list.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. **Next Step if You’re Curious**\n\nIf you want a _real_ sense of whether these were legitimate accounts:\n\n1.  Sort by file size in the dump — larger HTML pages with specific profile details are the ones worth checking.\n2.  Manually visit those links in a normal browser (not Spiderfoot) and see if they’re active or archived.\n3.  For dead pages, plug them into the **Wayback Machine** — Spiderfoot sometimes half-checks this but times out a lot.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can **filter this entire output to a shortlist of only the “probably real” matches**, so you’re not staring at hundreds of junk entries.
