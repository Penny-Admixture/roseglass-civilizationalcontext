Your big, goofy CRT-ass vapor platformer aesthetic is coming to life. Based on the screenshot:\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ What’s Working\n\n*   The player texture is being used.\n*   The camera is zoomed in `Vector2(4, 4)` — gives it that chunky pixel art look without downscaling the actual resolution.\n*   Scene and input are wired up. Your `_physics_process()` and `_ready()` code looks good.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ Suggested Tweaks for Tight Vibes\n\n#### 1\\. **Sprite Stretching?**\n\nYour player sprite looks… horizontally stretched. That’s either:\n\n*   A `scale` applied to the `Sprite2D` node\n*   The texture region being distorted\n*   The image itself being a portrait photo in a horizontal zoom window\n\nTo fix:\n\n```gdscript\n$Sprite2D.scale = Vector2(0.25, 0.25)  # Or whatever looks proportional\n```\n\nOr just set the scale in the inspector to keep it square-ish.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 2\\. **Camera2D Anchor Lock (Optional, but Clean)**\n\nIf the camera ever jitters or doesn’t follow the player properly, add:\n\n```gdscript\n$Camera2D.make_current()\n```\n\nin `_ready()`.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 3\\. **Playfield Too Small?**\n\nWant the background/floor to match the zoomed scale? Just make sure:\n\n*   Any floor tiles or background sprites are big enough (visually)\n*   Collision shapes (like `TileMap` or ground platforms) are _underneath the player_, scaled accordingly, or placed at Y = 0+\n\nI can give you a prebuilt big goofy platform scene that’ll match this vibe if you want — just say the word and I’ll zip it.\n\n* * *\n\nWould you like:\n\n*   a test floor prefab to match this zoom?\n*   jumping sound/animation logic?\n*   CRT scanline shader to match the vibes?\n\nLet’s get this cursed porch-dwelling grill knight _jumping_.","role":"assistant"}]}
