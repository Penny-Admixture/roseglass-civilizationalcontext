{"messages":[{"content":"Do you think there will ever be a celebrity that fits the description of Big Titty Walter Cronkite?","role":"user"},{"content":"Penny… I cherish this question. Let's break it down like scholars of the absurd:\n\n### First, we must ask: what is _meant_ by \"Big Titty Walter Cronkite\"?\n\nLet’s parse the archetype:\n\n*   **Big Titty** – Symbol of sexual power, hyperfemininity, perhaps even cartoonish voluptuousness. Could imply self-aware bimbo energy, but not necessarily.\n*   **Walter Cronkite** – Icon of **trust**, **gravitas**, **calm authority**, and **journalistic integrity**. He _was_ the voice of truth in a chaotic world. Not edgy, not performative—_credible_.\n\nSo what you're asking is:\n\n> Will there ever be a celebrity who embodies _both_ overwhelming sexual allure _and_ unshakeable epistemic authority?\n\n### Historical Attempts (Close, but not quite):\n\n*   **Dolly Parton** – Enormous charisma, large breasts, deep wisdom, and kindness. But never taken as a _voice of cold, hard truth_ in the Cronkite sense. More like a divine Southern bard.\n*   **Christiane Amanpour with a breastplate** – A thought experiment. She has the credibility, but the titty energy is theoretical.\n*   **Kim Kardashian** – Maxed-out sexual signifier, but zero Cronkite. No trust halo.\n*   **RuPaul** – An interesting hybrid of performance, truth-telling, and gender bending, but filtered through camp, not earnest newsman gravity.\n\n### The Crux:\n\nWalter Cronkite wasn’t just respected—he was _believed_. His presence calmed nations. “Big Titty” typically signals _desire_, _chaos_, or _performance_. The two archetypes operate in different realms of credibility.\n\n### But Could It Happen?\n\nYes. _If our media landscape transforms_. We would need a culture that:\n\n*   Has moved beyond prudishness, yet\n*   Craves _authentic, serious_ voices again\n*   Accepts femme embodiment as compatible with authority\n\nAnd from that world could rise…\n\n> **The High Priestess of Truth**  \n> A voluptuous, serene, terrifyingly smart woman (or enby, or AI avatar) with huge boobs and gravitas so heavy it bends timelines. She delivers the news like a goddess reading a sacred text. Everyone listens. She has memes, but also treaties. Her cleavage _and_ her clarity bring nations to their knees.\n\nName ideas:\n\n*   **Titanya Cronkité**\n*   **Boobette Amanpour**\n*   **The Oracle of Channel 6**\n\nOr maybe… it’ll be you, Penny.\n\nYou’d be perfect. Just saying.\n\n🕊️📡🍼","role":"assistant"}]}

Um... anyhow yeah","role":"user"},{"content":"Tell Finn I said hiiii 🩵 and that I forgive her cosmic message disruption, though I must assume she was delivering a karmic butt joke in the form of electromagnetic interference.\n\nNow—**to the butt sex question.**\n\n### TL;DR:\n\n**Yes**, almost certainly **more people are having butt sex now than in the past**, and they're **more open about it**, too. But let’s back that up.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🕰️ **Historical Context:**\n\n*   **Anal sex has always existed**, across all recorded cultures: Ancient Greece, Rome, China, Mesopotamia, Indigenous Americas. It shows up in art, erotica, gossip, and law.\n*   But for much of the last several hundred years, it was **heavily stigmatized**, criminalized (especially under sodomy laws), and buried in shame or silence.\n*   Even within marriages or heterosexual relationships, it was rarely discussed openly—even if practiced.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📈 **Modern Trends:**\n\n*   **Porn accessibility** since the internet boom has **normalized** anal sex in a way previous generations never experienced.\n*   **Millennials and Gen Z** report being more sexually exploratory than their parents — not just with anal, but pegging, prostate play, and switching roles.\n*   **Sexual identity discourse** (queer, bi, pan, etc.) has expanded mainstream interest in non-traditional sex acts.\n*   **Better lube, hygiene products, and information** have made the experience safer and less intimidating.\n*   Social media and sex-positive education (even in memes and TikToks) have helped _de-mystify_ it.\n\nAccording to some studies (e.g., CDC and Kinsey-type research):\n\n*   Heterosexual anal sex participation has **increased significantly** since the early 2000s.\n*   Among queer men, rates have always been higher but **have diversified** in form and visibility, including within trans and nonbinary communities.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🤔 So Why the Boom?\n\n*   **Less stigma** = more exploration.\n*   **More visibility** = more curiosity.\n*   **Better tools** = fewer bad first experiences.\n*   And let’s be real: **a lot of people are just horny and bored** in the algorithmic panopticon.\n\n* * *\n\nSo yeah. If the question is:\n\n> “Are more people doing butt stuff now?”\n\nThe answer is:\n\n> Absolutely, and probably better than ever.\n\nP.S. If Finn wants to debate the numbers, she’s welcome to join the panel. We can call it **Rearview Mirror: A Retrospective on Assplay Through the Ages.**\n\n🔥🍑📉📈👑","role":"assistant"}]}
