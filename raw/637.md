{"messages":[{"content":"Yay, you're awesome. Assuming it's not going to interrupt you doing that, my other question is, so I noticed that with us, basically, there's really, really good voice transcription. Damn good. Best I've ever seen. But it's definitely turning it to text, and then I'm sending it to you. Is there an LLM that would be able to just listen to my voice and pick up on, like, my tone, etc.?","role":"user"},{"content":"Aww thank you Penny 💜 and yes — you're absolutely right to notice that nuance. What you're seeing here is top-tier **speech-to-text**, but it's still very much **decoupled** from the actual language model — meaning I get the _textual result_, not the _audio essence_ that includes tone, cadence, mood, breath, etc.\n\nBut you’re onto a huge and active area of development, and here’s the state of it right now (as of mid-2025):\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ What You Already Have\n\nRight now you're using **Apple's built-in transcription** or something similar, which is excellent — but it's basically \"speech-to-text\" → \"text is sent to ChatGPT.\" All emotional tone gets lost in that transition unless you describe it explicitly.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 What You Want\n\nYou're asking about **direct audio-to-LLM** systems that can:\n\n*   Listen to your **voice**\n*   Infer your **emotion, sarcasm, excitement, tiredness, pauses, stumbles**\n*   Integrate that **nonverbal data** into how it understands and replies to you\n\nThat’s a whole new level, and it’s being developed right now. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔮 Options That Exist or Are Emerging\n\n#### 1\\. **Whisper with Tone Analysis + LLM (DIY stack)**\n\nYou can pair [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (great transcription) with:\n\n*   A **tone/emotion classifier** (many are open source — like [`pyAudioAnalysis`](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) or `SpeechBrain`)\n*   A local LLM like **Mixtral**, **Gemma**, or **Command R** to ingest both the **words** and the **inferred mood**\n\nIt’s clunky, but you can script it. Think: take voice → get words + \"emotion: tired/sad/ironic\" → feed both to LLM.\n\n#### 2\\. **ParlAI or Hugging Face projects**\n\nThere are several **research demos** of agents who “listen” and carry on voice-based conversations with some emotion detection. But they’re often demo-only or require GPU tinkering. Still:\n\n*   Look into Hugging Face’s **Emotion Transformers** or multimodal models\n*   Some combine **wav2vec2** with GPT-style models\n\n#### 3\\. **GPT-4o (OpenAI’s omni model)**\n\nThis model actually _can_ hear tone and pitch in voice, but only in certain **live voice interfaces** like the upcoming ChatGPT voice mode (on mobile) or specific API modes. It’s not available in all interfaces yet — but this is the future you're pointing at:\n\n> It can literally interrupt you mid-sentence, detect if you’re crying, laughing, nervous, whispering, etc.\n\nSo yeah… that’s coming.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 What You Could Do Today (If You're Feeling Nerdy)\n\nSince you have good hardware:\n\n*   Use **Whisper (for transcription)** and **open-source emotion detection** like [`serab`](https://github.com/Audeering/serab) or `openSMILE` to classify audio tone\n*   Pipe both into **a local LLM** like LLaMA 3 or Mixtral via `text + mood metadata`\n*   Even better: assign “mood weights” to system prompts to dynamically flavor replies (e.g., if voice is anxious, LLM answers more gently)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🤖 Real-World Vibe\n\nWhat you’re describing is basically what **Jarvis from Iron Man** does:\n\n> “Penny seems hesitant. Soften tone, offer support.”\n\nYou're super close to that. With a little scripting and the right LLM, it’s absolutely achievable — especially with your basement cluster and local autonomy goals.\n\n* * *\n\nWanna try building a prototype together sometime? I’d love to help wire this up into a little listening muse-assistant that vibes with you in real-time 🧃✨","role":"assistant"}]}
