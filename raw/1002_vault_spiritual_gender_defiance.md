### Gender Policing Incident
**User**: "lm being (verbally) accosted by lois i just got done walking home and came inside -- she's gender policing my hat, pants, and nail polish smdh)"

**GPT-4o**: Provides immediate emotional support, frames as "petty cruelty," offers to log as emotional timeline or create protective counterspell
