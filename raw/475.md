Psychoactive Fart Winemaking_, aka **\"Terroir of the Toot.\"** Let’s examine the prospects, hypothetically and biologically:\n\n* * *\n\n🧪 THE SCIENCE OF POOP FUMES (aka \"Volatile Organic Compounds in Fecal Gas\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHuman fecal gases and fermentation vapors are composed of:\n\n*   **Methane** (CH₄) – not psychoactive\n*   **Hydrogen sulfide** (H₂S) – toxic\n*   **Ammonia** – toxic\n*   **Indoles & skatole** – responsible for “poop smell”\n*   **Short-chain fatty acids** – can modulate gut-brain signaling\n*   **Volatile amines** – occasionally neuroactive in other contexts\n\nThese are byproducts of _gut microbiota metabolizing whatever you've eaten_. So theoretically, yeah:\n\n> **You are what your bacteria eat.**\n\n* * *\n\n🍷 CAN TERROIR-LIKE CONSUMPTION SHAPE THE FUMES?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely. Diet dramatically alters the profile of gas emissions:\n\n| Food Type | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| High-protein (esp. sulfur-rich) | More H₂S, mercaptans = rotten egg |\n| Fiber/prebiotic-rich | More fermentation = methane, CO₂ |\n| Spices (cumin, garlic, etc.) | May affect breath & fecal volatiles |\n| Psychedelic/precursor compounds | ??? uncertain, most broken down or absorbed first |\n\nSo in a “Jenkem sommelier” scenario, you might imagine:\n\n*   _Brazilian Amazonian ayahuasca-based fume culture_\n*   _French “truffle-fed” microbiomes_\n*   _NorCal vegan myco-brew artisanal fart wine_\n\nYou could even map out **gut biome terroir**, like:\n\n*   _\"This batch is from a woman who lived 3 months on nut butters, magnesium, and piracetam.\"_\n*   _\"Oh this one's a rare kombucha-fasted biochemist from Iceland with an O blood type.\"_\n\n* * *\n\n💊 CAN YOU ENHANCE FUME PSYCHOACTIVITY THROUGH DIET?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's the problem:\n\n1.  Most psychoactive compounds (e.g., tryptamines, cannabinoids, muscimol) are **absorbed and metabolized** long before they hit the colon.\n2.  The _microbial fermentation_ in your gut **does not reliably produce psychoactive derivatives** — at least not ones that would aerosolize and survive.\n3.  Even if it did, the **olfactory route to psychoactivity** is extremely limited (versus ingestion or injection). You're more likely to get dizzy from _toxic fumes_ than high from _designer poop gas_.\n\nBut…\n\n*   **Butyrate** and other SCFAs do influence mood and cognition — mostly through gut-brain axis signaling, not inhalation.\n*   Some bacteria like _Clostridium_ produce neurotoxins (e.g., botulinum), so you _can_ generate powerful compounds… though not ones you want in your sinuses.\n\n* * *\n\n🚽 IS THERE A MARKET FOR THIS?\n------------------------------\n\nThere’s a market for:\n\n*   Bathwater from e-girls\n*   Used panties from strangers\n*   Cryptid piss memes\n*   Fart jars (real: Stephanie Matto, 2022)\n\nSo yes. If someone with charisma (or hotness) and a signature gut biome put out a “psychoactive artisanal jenkem NFT drop,” some crypto-degenerate would absolutely buy it.\n\nYou could imagine:\n\n*   **Jenkem sommelier tasting wheels**\n*   **Probiotic tuning regimens**\n*   **AI fart profile matching tools**\n*   **Microbiome-on-chain tracking**\n\n* * *\n\n⚖️ CONCLUSION\n-------------\n\n*   Can diet change gas composition? ✅ Absolutely.\n*   Can you tune it toward _psychoactivity_? ❌ Not plausibly — not via inhalation.\n*   Could you build a cultural/ritual/performance art mythos around it? 💯 Yes.\n*   Would people try? 🧍They already have.\n\n* * *\n\n🗨️ Final Words\n---------------\n\nYou may not be able to make psychoactive poopgas, but you _could_ become the **Robert Parker of human fermentation terroir.** Go forth and rate the funk. The world is stupid enough for this to work.\n\n**Case dismissed. Court adjourned.**","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"What is the history of the split single?","role":"user"},{"content":"The **split single** — a format where two artists each contribute one track (usually one per side of a vinyl record or cassette) — has a rich and gritty history deeply tied to underground music scenes, DIY ethics, and cultural cross-pollination. Here's a high-speed, distortion-drenched history of the form:\n\n* * *\n\n🎞️ ORIGINS: PRE-PUNK ERA (1950s–1970s)\n---------------------------------------\n\nSplit singles weren’t always a statement. In the early vinyl era, particularly in the 1950s–60s, **budget labels** would sometimes press singles with two different artists (often unknowns) to fill space or capitalize on regional radio trends. These were more **pragmatic** than intentional collaborations.\n\nThink:\n\n*   Two completely unrelated artists\n*   Label-driven compilations masquerading as singles\n*   Cheap filler at gas stations and dime stores\n\nNo scene cred. No artistic synergy. Just plastic.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ BIRTH OF THE SCENE-SANCTIONED SPLIT (Late 1970s–1980s)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **punk and hardcore** scenes gave the split single its soul.\n\nSuddenly, a split wasn’t just a way to fill wax — it was:\n\n*   A **co-sign** between bands\n*   A **statement of community**\n*   A **shared tool** to break into new audiences\n\nExamples:\n\n*   **Discharge / M.A.D.** (UK punk split, 1980)\n*   **The Dicks / Big Boys** – _Live at Raul’s_ split LP (1980)\n*   **Hüsker Dü / Minutemen** – _Split EP_ (1981), SST Records\n\nSplit singles became common in scenes where touring bands would crash on each other’s floors and help each other press records. It was punk diplomacy.\n\n* * *\n\n☠️ GRINDCORE, CRUST, AND NOISE EXPLOSION (1990s)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNo genre loved splits more than **grindcore**. In the '90s, a grind band _wasn’t real_ unless they’d done at least four splits on obscure Czech or Malaysian labels.\n\nThis era birthed:\n\n*   **Napalm Death / S.O.B.**\n*   **Agathocles** (kings of the split — released dozens)\n*   **Merzbow** trading noise fragments across continents\n*   **Crass Records** doing radical-political splits with anarcho bands\n\nSplits were an _international language_. No Spotify algorithm could connect Tokyo noise with Brazilian crust like a 7\" mail order could.\n\n* * *\n\n📼 CASSETTE CULTURE + LO-FI INDIE (1990s–2000s)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAs cassettes re-emerged in underground scenes, the **split tape** flourished:\n\n*   Perfect for bedroom pop, noise, outsider folk\n*   Cheap to dub, DIY as hell\n*   Built-in audience sharing — each artist brings their crowd\n\nClassic examples:\n\n*   **Mt. Eerie / No Kids**\n*   **Xiu Xiu / The Dead Science**\n*   **Animal Collective / Vashti Bunyan** (okay, this never happened, but _should have_)\n\n* * *\n\n🎧 DIGITAL & POST-PHYSICAL ERA (2010s–now)\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn the streaming age, splits persist — but now often as:\n\n*   Split _Bandcamp_ releases\n*   Collab EPs with distinct artist tracks\n*   Mutual cover projects (e.g., each artist covers the other)\n\nLabels like **Deathwish Inc.**, **Sacred Bones**, and **Whited Sepulchre Records** still press splits, especially for niche vinyl lovers. Some experimental netlabels treat splits like **digital rituals** — two artists bringing spells to the same altar.\n\n* * *\n\n🔮 CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE\n------------------------\n\nSplit singles are:\n\n*   A **gesture of friendship**\n*   A **scene artifact**\n*   A **marketing hack**\n*   A **punk vestigial organ** in a streaming world\n\nThey’re often messy, asymmetrical, and beautiful — like a conversation, or a wrestling match.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Side Note: Split ≠ Compilation\n---------------------------------\n\nUnlike comps, **splits involve only two artists**, and there’s usually an _intentional symmetry_: one song each, one side each, one shoutout in the liner notes that’s just a heart emoji and a thanks to the DIY venue in Columbus.\n\n* * *\n\nWant a **top 10 legendary splits** list?
