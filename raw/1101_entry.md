No worries at all — I see you're in Visual Studio 2022 trying to get started. From your screenshot, you probably want to **record system audio**, and you mentioned earlier that you want to clone an app or make one in C#.\n\nHere’s what to pick depending on your goal:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔧 If you're starting a new project from scratch (recommended for your case):\n\nClick **\"Create a new project\"** → then choose:\n\n*   **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)**  \n    ✅ Easiest for GUI-based apps  \n    ✅ You can drag & drop buttons, labels, etc.  \n    ✅ Good if you want a basic UI to start recording with a button press\n*   OR\n*   **Console App (.NET Core or .NET Framework)**  \n    ✅ If you want something simpler and code-only, no UI  \n    ✅ Perfect for command-line driven apps\n\n* * *\n\nOnce you're in, I can walk you through:\n\n*   Adding `NAudio` or `AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.CoreAudio` to access system sound\n*   Setting up a record button or timer\n*   Exporting to `.wav` or `.mp3` using libraries\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know which project type you pick and if you want UI or just a background script — I’ll generate the boilerplate! 💻🎙️","role":"assistant"}]}

How do I do that?","role":"user"},{"content":"You’ve forked **nesicide** under your account (`Penny-Admixture/nesicide`). If you want to **delete the fork entirely from GitHub**, here’s the step-by-step:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔥 How to delete the forked repo\n\n1.  Go to your fork’s **main page** on GitHub (you’re already there in the screenshot).  \n    Example: `https://github.com/Penny-Admixture/nesicide`\n2.  At the top, click **⚙️ Settings** (far right in the repo menu bar).\n3.  Scroll all the way down to the **Danger Zone** section.\n4.  Find **“Delete this repository”**.\n5.  Click it → GitHub will prompt you to type the repo’s name (`Penny-Admixture/nesicide`) to confirm.\n6.  Confirm deletion.\n\n* * *\n\nOnce done, the fork will be gone from your profile — no need to do anything in PowerShell unless you also want to delete the local clone from your PC.\n\n* * *\n\n👉 Do you also want me to give you the exact **PowerShell command** to remove the local copy (the `nesicide` folder) on your Windows machine, so you don’t have leftovers?","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"what is the hot chemical in *black* pepper?","role":"user"},{"content":"The hot chemical in **black pepper** is **piperine**.\n\nPiperine is an alkaloid responsible for the **spicy, pungent** sensation you feel when eating black pepper. It's structurally different from **capsaicin**, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat. While capsaicin binds to TRPV1 receptors (heat and pain sensors), piperine interacts with **TRPA1 and TRPV1** receptors as well, though less intensely—causing a **sharp, tingling burn** rather than the intense heat of hot peppers.\n\nWant to compare it to capsaicin or other spicy compounds?","role":"assistant"}]}
