It looks really expensive and mysterious.","role":"user"},{"content":"Ooh, nice find. That’s a **Phoenix #FAM610 Top Board**, listed for a wild $720 at the MSU Surplus Store — which suggests it’s probably from some industrial or lab-grade system. Based on the visual inspection and context clues, here's what I can tell you:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 **What is it?**\n\nThe Phoenix FAM610 Top Board appears to be a **specialized industrial controller or test interface board**. It's not a general-purpose consumer electronics board like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi — it’s more like something you'd find inside an OEM diagnostics system, HVAC controller, or scientific/medical testing rig.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔧 **Key Features Noticed on the PCB:**\n\n*   **Push buttons, LEDs, and rotary dial**: Likely for manual control or diagnostics.\n*   **LCD display**: Indicates it's intended to display live feedback or data.\n*   **Relays, potentiometers, and op-amps**: Signals it's doing analog signal processing or I/O calibration.\n*   **Labeling like \"PHOTO CELL ADJ\"**: Suggests it's part of a light-sensing or optical detection system.\n*   **\"FAULT AOK\", \"WASTE\", \"NORMAL\" LEDs**: These are classic indicators for error/status monitoring.\n*   **Phoenix Contact logo**: They manufacture high-end industrial automation and control gear.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **What might it be for?**\n\nPossibilities:\n\n*   A **calibration/test interface** for some piece of equipment (e.g., environmental sensors, waste monitoring, or photodetection).\n*   A **top control board** for a modular industrial automation system — the \"top\" in the name hints at it being just one piece of a stackable unit.\n*   It may have come from a **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** environment or a proprietary control system.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💰 **Why $720?!**\n\nThat price is absurd for hobbyists but actually **normal for industrial or research gear**, especially if:\n\n*   It’s from a discontinued but still-used system.\n*   It’s sold to replace parts in systems costing tens or hundreds of thousands.\n*   There's no public documentation or third-party replacement available.\n\nMSU Surplus likely got it from decommissioned lab equipment or a campus facility and just priced it based on original acquisition cost.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 TL;DR\n\nIt’s a **specialty industrial controller board**, probably part of a sensor or automation system — not something you’d buy unless you’re maintaining that exact equipment. But if you’re collecting rare, mysterious hardware or building a mad scientist lab aesthetic? Extremely cool piece.\n\nWould you like help looking up any datasheets or potential uses for those specific components?","role":"assistant"}]}

This is actually from my personal collection, so I know what it is. What do you think it is?","role":"user"},{"content":"😏 Ohoho, a _dusty_ enigma cube. I love a trick question.\n\nLet’s do a visual autopsy:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔎 What I see:\n\n*   **Top-mounted cooling fan** (standard 80mm?) — pretty beefy, like something you'd see on a CPU heatsink.\n*   **Large heatsink underneath** — this is definitely cooling _something hot_, likely a high-power chip.\n*   **Visible PCB layers** — sandwich-style, supported by standoffs.\n*   **DC barrel jack** on the visible side — classic 12V-ish power input.\n*   **USB port** (likely USB Mini-B or Micro-B) — data interface?\n*   **Heatpipe / copper element** sneaking into view — again suggests this is cooling a power-hungry chip.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 What I _think_ it is:\n\nThis looks like an **ASIC miner** — possibly a **Bitmain Antminer U1/U2 style USB miner** or a **single-board SHA256 miner** from the earlier Bitcoin/Litecoin mining days (2013–2016ish).\n\n*   The **tower-style fan and heatsink** layout is common for older USB ASIC sticks that needed active cooling when running 24/7.\n*   The **DC barrel jack + USB combo** is exactly what many of those used: USB for data, DC for extra power.\n*   The **hefty black base** might be a custom stand or just the housing for power delivery.\n\nAlternatively, this _could_ also be a **Jetson TX1/TX2 dev board** or similar AI/single-board computing platform, but that usually looks flatter and has HDMI ports — which I don't see here.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 Final Guess:\n\n**Early-generation USB-powered ASIC crypto miner**, possibly overclocked (hence the chunky fan and copper heatpipe). Something like:\n\n*   **ASICMiner Block Erupter**\n*   **GekkoScience Compac**\n*   Or a **custom FPGA-based miner**\n\nAm I warm? 🧐🔥","role":"assistant"}]}
