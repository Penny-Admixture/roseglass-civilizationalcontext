They _skipped the beginning_ to drop us straight into an **imagined continuity**, implying **there was already a past**, a movement, a structure.\n\n*   _“Second Annual Report”_ says: _you missed the first, but it existed. This is official._\n*   _Street Fighter II_ says: _this world’s been going on. These fighters have beef. Get in._\n\n* * *\n\nYou're right: it's when **form meets style**, when the art stops being _prototype_ and becomes _world_.  \nThat’s when it starts to **matter**.\n\nWant me to draw more parallels between glitchy noise art, early fighting games, and that moment when an aesthetic becomes a _scene_?","role":"assistant"}]}
