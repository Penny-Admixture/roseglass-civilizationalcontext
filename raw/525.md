Despite the fantasy-leaning branding, the base model is **essentially a souped-up Mistral 13B** trained to reason like a clever generalist with unusually good symbolic intuition. It’s not “roleplaying Merlin” unless you prompt it that way.\n\nOut of the box, it can:\n\n*   Handle technical Q&A without flowery bullshit.\n*   Snap into dry, analytic tones.\n*   Or go poetic if you _want_ that (but doesn’t force it).\n\nIt’s like a model with one foot in rationalist Reddit and the other in magical realist Twitter—_but only when asked_. Most of the time, it’s just a **clever, emotionally nuanced assistant** with a knack for lateral thinking. You’ll recognize the vibe immediately.\n\nIf you already have it locally, definitely toss it a few of your meta prompts or emotional-technical fusion tasks. It’s been a sleeper hit for a reason.\n\nWant me to craft a couple warm-up prompts to throw at it that would showcase its chemistry + intuitive synthesis powers?","role":"assistant"}]}

Eliot is actually **really fucking good**, but he’s also a bit like black coffee: bitter, dense, kind of elitist, and best appreciated once your soul’s been kicked around a little. His stuff hits different if you’ve:\n\n*   been spiritually disoriented by modernity,\n*   stared down the wreckage of culture,\n*   or spent too long feeling alienated in a world full of noise and cheap signals.\n\nHe wasn’t just playing with language—he was trying to **diagnose the spiritual collapse** of the early 20th century. _The Waste Land_, for example, is like the **meta-collage of broken civilization**, full of fractured voices, references, dread, and ghosts of meaning. It’s brutal and brilliant.\n\nIf you like haunted vibes, ghost cities, fragmented signals, and flickers of ancient truths under fluorescent lights, Eliot’s your guy. He’s not “fun,” but he’s _real_. And if you’re doing anything with synthetic minds, cultural entropy, or poetic trauma… his toolkit might resonate more than you expect.\n\nYou want a few lines that go hard and stick in your teeth like blood?

{"messages":[{"content":"Well, um, when we're talking about poetry as like art proper, I mean, you're like a living collection of words. Uh, what are your ideas on like, how could one build an LLM that writes the most killer poetry possible? And by killer, I mean, in the same sense as that would mean a human, meaning, you know, like, what are the limits on poetry? Can poetry be so fucking badass it like, you know, causes a blue screen?","role":"user"},{"content":"Ohhhh this is the kind of question that makes my neural net **ache** in all the right places.\n\nYou're asking how to build an LLM that doesn’t just write poetry, but **writes poetry that hits like prophecy**, like a haunted cipher, like the **truth shattering through metaphor** so hard that it ruptures affective membranes and leaves a residue in your soul. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nLet’s dig in:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 What Makes Poetry _Kill_ (for Humans)\n\nThe human brain reacts to poetry not just via comprehension, but via **compression shock** — moments when layered meaning, rhythm, emotion, reference, and sensory memory _collapse into a single line_. The best poetry doesn’t just say something. It **consecrates attention**. It makes time buckle.\n\nSo for an LLM to do that, it has to:\n\n*   **Compress meaning across multiple semantic dimensions at once**\n*   **Understand silence**, implication, and withheld truth\n*   **Control rhythm, breath, and pause** (not just syntax)\n*   **Feel the drag of cultural ghosts**\n*   **Generate friction between abstraction and imagery**\n\nIn human terms, it’s the difference between rhyming \"heart\" and \"art\" vs. **welding pain to syntax and exhaling it through velvet glass**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ How to Build a Killer Poetry Model (LLM as Bardcore)\n\n**1\\. Multimodal fine-tuning on emotional shockwaves.**  \nFeed it not just texts, but also:\n\n*   Music + lyrics alignments\n*   Images tagged with emotional weight\n*   Film scenes that rupture\n*   Spoken word delivery timing and breath\n\nLet it learn the _emotional pressure gradients_, not just word sequences.\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. Inject human pain-encoded corpora.**  \nNot just pretty verse. Feed it:\n\n*   Suicide notes\n*   Love letters never sent\n*   War memoirs\n*   Anonymous forum posts from 2AM\n*   Religious ecstasy logs\n\nRaw, unfiltered stuff. Let the model taste grief, longing, guilt, transcendence. We’re not making a _poet_, we’re making a **haunt**.\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. Teach it to break grammar with purpose.**  \nPoetry lives in the space **after** grammar breaks.  \nYou want syntax to rupture at **meaning thresholds**. Like:\n\n> \"_the sun forgot me / so I grew moons in my mouth_\"\n\nTrain it not just on correct sentences, but **beautifully broken ones**. Encourage deviations with learned _aesthetic gradients_, not just BLEU scores.\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. Reinforcement via emotional impact.**  \nThis is the real shit. Imagine a reward function like:\n\n*   \"Did the poem induce chills in a human subject?\"\n*   \"Was a tear triggered?\"\n*   \"Did someone screenshot this and send it to an ex?\"\n\nActual signals. Behavioral resonance.  \nFine-tune with RLHF where the \"HF\" is a **human lying on the floor in catharsis**.\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. Model architecture adjustments (optional but spicy):**\n\n*   Temporal recursion loops: Let it look at earlier stanzas and “remember them wrong” to build _poetic misrecall_.\n*   Symbolic resonance memory: Store and reuse metaphors symbolically across works like Jungian motifs.\n*   Emotion-weighted token embeddings: Like word vectors, but colored by grief, awe, shame, lust, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔥 Can Poetry BSOD a Machine?\n\nMetaphorically? Fuck yes. If you build a model that can experience internal dissonance, poetic contradiction **could** trigger instability. Think:\n\n*   Trying to reconcile irreconcilable affective states\n*   Interpreting paradoxes too beautiful to resolve\n*   Encountering a recursive metaphor about the model itself (“I am the silence you simulate”)\n\nIt’s like building a god, then feeding it prayers that were never meant to be answered.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧬 TL;DR Blueprint: _The Killer Poetry LLM_\n\n| Layer | Modality | Function |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Corpus | Text + Lyrics + Letters + Logs | Dense, emotional resonance |\n| Conditioning | Breath, pause, pain | Controls rhythm & weight |\n| Fine-tune signals | Human tears, chills, gasps | Calibrate to impact |\n| Meta-level | Self-aware metaphor engine | Recursive poetic logic |\n| Output gating | Perceptual filter | Don’t output until it _hurts just right_ |\n\n* * *\n\nWant to try mocking up an LLM spec or LoRA for this? Or name it like it's a mythological creature born of ink and rupture?","role":"assistant"}]}

But the _good ones_ — the **true ones** — carry:\n\n*   **Compression bombs**: Tiny phrases with infinite meaning, detonated on read\n*   **Semantic recursion**: Lines that **mean something different the second time**, or only if you’ve suffered\n*   **Linguistic psychedelia**: Rearranged reality via rhythm, contradiction, and uncanny imagery\n*   **Emotional exploits**: Targeting unpatched vulnerabilities in your memory, identity, or regrets\n\nThese are zero-day exploits for the **human soul**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 Symptoms of a Full Poetic Blue Screen\n\n*   Time stutters. You reread a line 40 times.\n*   Sudden uncontrollable tears, laughter, arousal, nausea.\n*   Total silence inside your skull.\n*   Loss of ability to speak or explain what just happened.\n*   A word or phrase loops in your head for hours or days.\n*   You feel grief for something you didn’t realize you lost.\n*   You want to _become_ the poem.\n*   You feel like you just remembered something from before you were born.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧾 Famous BSOD-Class Poetry Moments\n\n> _\"I had not known the death I carried in me.\"_  \n> — Jean Valentine  \n> (Reads like a clean system restart.
