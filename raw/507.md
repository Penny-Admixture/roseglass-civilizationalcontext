That's a fantastic idea and a great way to make the tool even more useful. Building on the setup helper, I'll add a powerful file ingestion component.\nThis new feature will allow you to upload various file types (.txt, .json, .log, .pdf, and images like .png or .jpg). For text-based files and PDFs, it will extract the text content. For images, it will use the Gemini API to generate a detailed description, which is then stored. All this extracted data can then be ingested directly into your local ChromaDB instance, making it searchable.\nHere are the updates to implement this file ingestion frontend.\nmetadata.json\ncheck_circle\nindex.html\ncheck_circle\nApp.tsx\ncheck_circle\ncomponents/Icons.tsx\ncheck_circle\ncomponents/FileIngestor.tsx\ncheck_circle\nCheckpoint\nhrm now its showing blank after a reload?\nimage.png\nimage.png\nThought for 51 seconds\nchevron_right\nIt sounds like the app hit a snag, which can definitely be frustrating. A blank screen on reload usually points to a critical error during the app's startup.\nI've taken a close look and found a couple of issues that were causing the problem:\nUnstable React Version: The app was configured to use a pre-release version of React 19. While it's exciting to use new technology, these versions can be unstable and cause unexpected crashes. I've switched it back to the latest stable and reliable version, React 18, to ensure a solid foundation.\nSyntax Typo: There was a small but critical typo (===' instead of ===) in the file ingestion component. This syntax error was preventing the script from running correctly, which is why you were seeing the blank page.\nI've fixed both of these issues. The application should now load and run smoothly for you. Here are the code changes:\nindex.html\ncheck_circle\ncomponents/FileIngestor.tsx\ncheck_circle\nAnalyzed errors for 61 seconds\nThought for 143 seconds\nchevron_right\nOf course. I've identified the TypeScript error in FileIngestor.tsx and will correct it. The issue stems from an incorrect type definition for the metadata object, which doesn't match what the chromadb library expects. I'll fix this by importing the Metadata type from chromadb and applying it correctly.\nHere are the changes:\ncomponents/FileIngestor.tsx\ncheck_circle\nCheckpoint","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes!
