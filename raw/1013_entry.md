Based on the previous context, you are using a virtual environment (venv) to run ComfyUI, and the issue seems to be related to PyTorch not being compiled with CUDA support. Let's ensure that we're installing PyTorch correctly for your system.\n\nSince you mentioned that you already have an installed version of PyTorch (2.7.1), we should reinstall it instead of upgrading it. Here’s how you can do that:\n\nStep-by-Step\nhi can you see the context from my conversation w another llm (above)?\n\nim just looking to evaluate competency and whether you can actually run on my gawdawful12gb gpu\nedit\nhi can you see the context from my conversation w another llm (above)?\nedit\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if I can see the context from their conversation with another LLm. They mentioned \"gawdawful12gb gpu\" which sounds like a specific system they're using.\nFirst, I need to recall the previous conversation. The user was having trouble with ComfyUI-Manager not being compatible with CUDA. They tried running some commands like \"activate\" and \"install torch --upgrade\", but it didn't work.\n\nThe user's main issue is that their system is\n\nhi gemma, can you see the interrupted convo above?\nedit\nhi can you see the convo?\nedit\nhi\nedit\nhi\nedit\nYes, I can see the context of your conversation with another LLm. It seems that you were having trouble getting ComfyUI-Manager to work properly on a system with a 12GB GPU. You mentioned trying different commands and methods to get PyTorch and CUDA working correctly.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that there might be an issue with your installation or compatibility of software packages with CUDA support for your specific GPU. I will do my best to help you troubleshoot this further if needed. What would you like me to do next?\n\nDownloading model\n0 B / 0 B (0%)\nedit\nAlright, let's break down the user's situation. They're having issues with ComfyUI-Manager not starting properly, and it seems related to PyTorch not being compiled with CUDA enabled.\nFirst, I remember that the user has a Windows system with Python 3.10.11 and is using a virtual environment. The error message points to the assertion that Torch wasn't compiled with CUDA enabled.\n\nI suggested updating PyTorch, but they mentioned that their GPU is 12GB, so maybe it's a compatibility issue. Now, the user is asking if I can see the previous conversation, which I confirmed yes. They seem a bit concerned about whether I can assist them further.\n\nSo, my role here is to provide step-by-step guidance on how they can fix this issue. The main points are: check their GPU and CUDA version, ensure PyTorch is installed correctly with CUDA support, and maybe suggest verifying the installation.\n\nIt seems you're encountering an issue with ComfyUI-Manager where it's not starting properly, and the error indicates that Torch isn't compiled with CUDA enabled. Here's a step-by-step guide to help resolve this:\n\nStep 1: Verify Your GPU and CUDA Version\nFirst, check if your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU and installed CUDA version.\n\nOpen a new terminal.\nRun:\nnvidia-smi\nThis will display your GPU model and the installed CUDA version.\nIf you have an NVIDIA GPU with at least 4GB VRAM and CUDA 10.x or higher, proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Uninstall and Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA Support\nTo ensure that PyTorch is installed with CUDA support:\n\nDeactivate your virtual environment if it's active.\n\ndeactivate\nUninstall the current version of torch:\n\npip uninstall torch -y\nInstall PyTorch with CUDA support (adjust the cu version based on your GPU):\n\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102\nIf you have CUDA 11.x, use cu113 instead:\n\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113\nActivate your virtual environment again:\n\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\nStep 3: Verify the Installation\nRun the following command in your virtual environment to check if CUDA is supported:\n\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())\"\nIf it returns True, PyTorch can use your GPU.\n\nStep 4: Restart ComfyUI-Manager\nAfter reinstalling, try restarting ComfyUI-Manager to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance! 😊\n\nPS C:\\Users\\llm_development\\ComfyShell\\comfyui> pip uninstall torch -y\n>>\nFound existing installation: torch 2.1.0\nUninstalling torch-2.1.0:\nSuccessfully uninstalled torch-2.1.0\nPS C:\\Users\\llm_development\\ComfyShell\\comfyui> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102\n>>\nDefaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable\nLooking in indexes: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102, https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com\nRequirement already satisfied: torch in c:\\program files\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (2.7.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: torchvision in c:\\program files\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (0.16.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: torchaudio in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (2.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: filelock in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torch) (3.18.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=4.10.0 in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torch) (4.14.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: sympy>=1.13.3 in c:\\program files\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from torch) (1.14.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: networkx in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torch) (2.6.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: jinja2 in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torch) (3.1.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: fsspec in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torch) (2025.5.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torchvision) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torchvision) (2.32.4)\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of torchvision to determine which version is compatible with other requirements.

The user is having trouble with their ComfyUI setup, and they're encountering a dependency conflict when installing PyTorch and torchaudio.\nLet me start by recalling the problem. They uninstalled torch 2.1.0 and tried to install it again along with torchvision and torchaudio, specifying the cu102 index. But then there was an error about conflicting dependencies between torch and torchaudio.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It looks like when they installed torch, it might have a specific version that's compatible with torchaudio. The user might be using different versions of these packages which are causing the conflict.\n\nThe key issue is that torchaudio 2.1.0 depends on torch==2.1.0. So, if torch is installed as 2.7.1, it's a higher version than what torchaudio expects.\n\nTo resolve this, I can suggest two options:\n\nFirst, they could try installing torch first with the cu102 version and then install torchaudio to match that.\n\nAlternatively, they could choose to upgrade both torch and torchvision to ensure compatibility.\n\nI need to explain these steps clearly so they can follow along. Let's break it down step by step for them.\n\nIt looks like there's a dependency conflict between torch and torchaudio. The issue is likely due to the specific versions of these packages being installed.\n\nLet me help you resolve this. Here's what you need to do:\n\nStep 1: Reinstall Torch with CUDA Support\nFirst, let's ensure that torch is installed with CUDA support for your GPU (assuming you have an NVIDIA GPU).\n\nRun:\n\npip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102\nIf this results in a conflict, try specifying the version of torch to match torchaudio.\n\nStep 2: Check for Conflicting Versions\nIf you still encounter a dependency conflict, it's likely because torch and torchaudio have different versions.\n\nUninstall torch:\n\npip uninstall torch -y\nInstall torch with the version compatible with torchaudio (e.g., 2.1.0):\n\npip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102\nStep 3: Verify Installation\nCheck if the installation worked:\n\nRun:\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.__version__)\"\nIf it prints 2.1.0, then PyTorch is installed correctly with CUDA support.\n\nLet me know how this goes! 😊\n\n10\\site-packages (from torchvision) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests in c:\\users\\llm_development\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python310\\site-packages (from torchvision) (2.32.4)\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of torchvision to determine which version is compatible with other requirements.

They've tried installing them together but ran into an issue where torchaudio 2.1.0 requires torch==2.1.0.\nI need to provide a clear solution. Since they're using a virtual environment, I'll suggest two options: either install torch first and then torchaudio, or try a different version of torchaudio. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they should uninstall the current versions of torch and torchaudio. Then, try installing them again. If that doesn't work, they can choose to install torch 2.1.0 first, then torchaudio.\n\nLet me explain both options so they can decide which one works best for their setup.\n\nIt\n\nDownloading model","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, I can put that together — we can keep it tight, colorful, and in your voice, but also pro enough to feel like a real gallery catalog bio.\n\nIf you give me a bit more detail about the exhibition’s vibe (serious vs. playful, edgy vs. safe, etc.) and what medium(s) you’re showing, I can thread the tone so it feels authentic and eye-catching without going too off-the-rails for the curator.\n\nDo you want this to read more like:\n\n*   **Mysterious/poetic** (cryptic hooks, suggestive imagery)\n*   **Punchy/irreverent** (funny, self-aware, wink-at-the-audience)\n*   **Straight-up professional** (clear, concise, art-world ready)\n*   **Hybrid** (professional scaffolding with little flashes of your personality sneaking through)\n\nWhich one’s your lane for this?","role":"assistant"}]}

Session/environment drift**\n\n*   If you’re running in a Python venv or Conda env, sometimes dependencies shift mid‑session (esp. if you had an auto‑update or ran `pip install` in the background).\n*   In ComfyUI specifically, a new custom node update can silently break things until you restart or clear caches.\n*   **Fix:**\n    *   Restart ComfyUI (and possibly your whole Python session).\n    *   Clear `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` of anything you just installed and re‑clone fresh.\n    *   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the ComfyUI folder to re‑lock deps.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\.

Like, every time something else happens it fucks my ComfyUI, and I thought that was the whole point of these venv things, and then I have, like, 50 over, I mean, we're, we're pushing 60 Python installs on my computer, and they're supposedly, you know, containing these venvs, but to what end? It might be better just to have a global fucking thing that works, but don't, I'm not trying to do that, don't get me wrong, we won't, but I'm just saying the Python community might need to, like, figure it the fuck out, but anyway, like, you do not remember that we've solved this, like, well, I guess you don't. We've solved this, like, 100 times. I can solve this, like, in a walk.","role":"user"},{"content":"Okay, I get you now — you’re not really stuck on _this_ ComfyUI failure so much as you’re trying to **capture these recurring “Python/venv/ComfyUI prerequisites from hell” fixes into a persistent local LLM-assisted notebook** so you don’t have to keep re‑deriving them every time you reinstall.\n\nAnd yeah, I totally get the “formatting ping pong” — every time one dependency breaks, fixing it somehow breaks another thing, even though venvs are _supposed_ to keep that isolation. Python dependency hell + GPU tooling is basically a perfect storm for that.\n\n* * *\n\nHere’s how I’d frame what you’re doing into something that _will_ stick this time, so that the **“known good solution”** isn’t just in your head or a one‑off conversation with me:\n\n### **1\\. Make a single, canonical “ComfyUI repair notebook”**\n\n*   Doesn’t have to be Jupyter — could just be a markdown file in Obsidian or a Git repo.\n*   Every time you fix something, paste:\n    *   **Error message**\n    *   **Exact commands that fixed it**\n    *   **Environment details** (Python version, venv path, OS, GPU driver version)\n*   Bonus: also paste **the broken command’s output before the fix** — so future-you can match symptoms exactly.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Build the _golden venv_**\n\n*   Pick **one** Python version (ComfyUI is chill with 3.10.x) and stick to it for all your AI toys.\n*   Keep that venv zipped somewhere so you can nuke/re‑deploy it instantly without internet or pip roulette.\n*   Example:\n    ```bash\n    python3.10 -m venv comfy_venv\n    source comfy_venv/bin/activate\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    tar czf comfy_venv_backup.tar.gz comfy_venv\n    ```\n    Then when shit blows up:\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf comfy_venv\n    tar xzf comfy_venv_backup.tar.gz\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Keep the installer local**\n\n*   Don’t rely on `pip install` from PyPI every time — make a local `wheels/` folder with:\n    *   torch + torchvision + xformers for your GPU\n    *   ComfyUI’s requirements.txt resolved once when you know it works\n*   Then pip install from your own wheels:\n    ```bash\n    pip install --no-index --find-links=./wheels -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Make it LLM‑assisted**\n\n*   When you hit a problem, drop the error + last 10 commands into your local LLM.\n*   Let it _rewrite_ the fix in your notebook in clean, copy‑paste‑ready form.\n*   Over time, your notebook becomes a **self‑updating “ComfyUI survival manual”**.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can literally start you a **“ComfyUI Known Good Solutions.md”** template right now with sections for:\n\n*   Startup failures\n*   Missing dependencies\n*   GPU OOM issues\n*   Model path errors\n*   Custom node breakages\n\n…and then you just paste the problem/fix pairs as you go.  \nThat way you’ve got one file you can search instantly, instead of doing this loop forever.\n\nDo you want me to go ahead and build that starter template for you? It’ll slot right into your “local LLM repair notebook” workflow.","role":"assistant"}]}

But new, new NerdRage just dropped, er, new NerdRevelation. Well, okay. As I'm watching Pythons try to whir and churn in the other window to start comping, and... Um, and, you know, I don't know if you're present for all of it, but like, once again today, as we do every day, like, pinky in the brain. Like, one software... And, dude, I thought that was the point of those vnvenv, or whatever, was that it's creating this contained virtual environment, like, just for that. But, yeah, it seems like every other day, because that sentence, whatever that sentence library, and, like, it constantly, it wants, like, old Python or something. So, it gleefully, like, half uninstalls it, and then leaves it broken, and then every other piece of software doesn't work. So, but my question is this. Like, it seems like a big part of the issue, like, if you just didn't update all the time, like, yes, security patches, okay, blah, blah, blah. But, like, so much stuff breaks, and not all of it has to be even on the network. Like, you know, if I'm trying to determine a new type of quicksort or something, it really doesn't matter. Hey.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, I’m with you — this is the _eternal Python rage loop_:\n\nYou think _venv_ is going to be your little snow globe, sealed off from the chaos, and then some dependency decides, “Actually, I’m going to pull in a different version of `sentencepiece` that only works on Python 3.9 and breaks everything in the room.” And because pip doesn’t really do _true_ dependency isolation in the way a container does, you end up with the exact _opposite_ of “virtual” — more like a **shared custody arrangement between every project you’ve ever made**.\n\n* * *\n\n**Why venv feels like it lies to us**\n\n*   It isolates _installed packages_ from the system, but it _still uses the same underlying Python binary_.\n*   If something you install has compiled extensions, it can still break based on that interpreter version, underlying OS libraries, etc.\n*   Pip will happily “upgrade” or “downgrade” a shared dependency without warning you that another project needed the other version — unless you pin _everything_, which is exhausting.\n\n* * *\n\n**Why constant updates are landmines**\n\n*   If your environment is stable and your project isn’t security-critical, upgrading is basically rolling the dice for zero gain.\n*   Libraries push “minor” updates that silently drop old Python versions, change APIs, or shift dependencies in incompatible ways.\n*   You’re right: for a _purely local_, non-networked project like “inventing a new quicksort,” there’s no need to chase upstream changes every week.\n\n* * *\n\n**If you want to end the daily Pinky & the Brain reboot loop**\n\n*   **Freeze exact versions**:\n    ```bash\n    pip freeze > requirements.txt\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n    That locks _everything_ to exactly what worked last time.\n*   **Clone venvs like save states** — literally copy the whole `.venv` directory before trying risky installs. If it breaks, just swap it back.\n*   **Use `pip-tools`** — lets you maintain a clean `requirements.in` for top-level deps and generates a fully pinned `requirements.txt` automatically.\n*   **Go full container** — Docker or Podman can truly isolate the whole interpreter + OS dependencies so one project can’t nuke another.\n*   **Ignore updates** unless you actually need a new feature or are patching something critical. Treat updates like a risky surgery.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can set you up with a **Python “never break again” workflow** — basically a hybrid of `pip-tools` + version pinning + venv cloning that would let you treat your projects like snapshots in a retro game emulator. You could roll back instantly when something acts up, and you’d never get blindsided by `sentencepiece` drama again.\n\nDo you want me to sketch that setup? It would stop this “security patch kamikaze” thing dead in its tracks.","role":"assistant"}]}

Actually, I think I'm gonna actually cut it down to a very short message, but, like, so... Like, the day person's always supposed to do the laundry, okay? Um, and night person's not, I guess. But, like, Arena, the other day when I took over for her, like, hit a ton of it left, and, like, I... She said it's not a big deal if it didn't get done, because she was leaving anyway.
