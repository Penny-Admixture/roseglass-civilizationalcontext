That kind of memory is excellent for running larger models or multiple smaller ones in parallel. Here are the key trade-offs and answers to your questions:\n\n### ✅ What it’s good for:\n\n*   **Running CPU-heavy inference tasks** (like smaller uncensored LLMs or vector databases)\n*   **Serving as an orchestrator, inference node, or file/database server** in your AI lab\n*   **Virtualization via Proxmox** (you can run multiple VMs or containers easily)\n*   **Mass storage w/ SAS drives** (if you get trays + a SAS controller or HBA)\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚠️ GPU Support Caveat:\n\nUnfortunately, the R620 is a **1U rack server**, and most **GPUs require more physical space (like 2U or tower cases)** for cooling and clearance. This means:\n\n*   **You can't easily add a full-sized GPU** like an RTX 3090 or A100 to this box.\n*   Some people hack low-profile cards in with PCIe risers, but airflow and power are serious problems in 1U cases.\n\n🛠️ If you're set on GPU use, better to:\n\n*   Use the R620 as a **CPU-heavy backend** (e.g., for vector search, file hosting, non-GPU microservices)\n*   Pair it with a separate tower or 2U server **with proper GPU support**\n\n* * *\n\n### Re: SAS Drives\n\nThat 3TB Dell Constellation SAS drive will only work if the machine has a **SAS backplane and controller** (most likely it does), but:\n\n*   It **won’t work** in standard consumer PCs unless you get a SAS HBA card.\n*   And the R620 uses **2.5\" drives**, while the SAS drive you posted is **3.5\"**, so you'd need a different model or an external SAS enclosure.\n\n* * *\n\n### TL;DR Summary:\n\n*   **Yes**, this server is super useful, just **not for GPU-intensive tasks**\n*   **No**, you can't easily add a GPU to it (consider a 2U or workstation box for that)\n*   It will shine as a **RAM-heavy orchestration node, storage host, or CPU-based model runner**\n\nLet me know if you want help speccing out a GPU-capable box from MSU surplus next 🖤","role":"assistant"}]}

It's designed to expand the storage capacity of a server or storage area network (SAN) system. It doesn’t do any processing itself—it just holds a bunch of drives (usually 2.5\" SAS drives) and makes them accessible over a high-speed connection like SAS.\n\n### 🧠 Notable characteristics:\n\n*   **No CPU/RAM/OS** – It’s not a server, so it won’t run software or boot an OS on its own.\n*   **Dual controllers on back** – Those blue modules are for redundancy and to connect to a server that will manage the disks.\n*   **Used with SANs** – Typically paired with Dell Compellent SC series controllers or any server with a compatible SAS interface.\n\n### 🔌 Use case:\n\n*   You connect it via SAS cables to a proper host (like your **Dell R620 server**) that has an **HBA (Host Bus Adapter)** card with external SAS ports.\n*   Then, your server sees all the drives in the enclosure as if they were locally attached.\n\n### ⚠️ Gotchas:\n\n*   You’ll need the proper **SAS interface card** (usually mini-SAS SFF-8088 or SFF-8644 depending on the generation).\n*   You’ll also need **drive trays** and actual **SAS drives**.\n*   Power hungry and loud—designed for datacenters.\n\n### 🔧 TL;DR:\n\n**Not a computer.**  \n**Very useful for mass storage** (like a breakbeat archive, media dump, or local S3-style bucket), but needs to be attached to a server with SAS support.\n\nWant help figuring out if your Dell R620 can talk to it directly, or what HBA cards would be compatible?","role":"assistant"}]}

I gotta just get another OCR app, or whatever, that I can just run, you know, I have, like, a little wood chipper sitting here on my iOS device, so...

Maybe this time, just do it, but in the future, I'm gonna do it. Um... It's weird that we're... Is this how AI saves our jobs? Ha ha ha ha! It'd be funny if that was, like... Hi, talking to ChatGPT. You may have heard of it, it's kind of famous. Lois came and started glaring out the back window at me. So... Um... But, yeah, so... Um... Maybe that's an interesting idea for, like, a sci-fi feature. Like... Some, you know, like, bullshit jobs, like, basically... They'll all just have bullshit jobs. Probably, human society would... Not... Really allow people to just acknowledge that, somehow. Because... Apparently, at the largest scales, we're, like, a weird... I don't know. Mormon family, or some shit. God forbid. So... Um... Yeah. The fucking shit with that stupid... I don't know why... Mine is usually nice, but, like... So, anyway. TLDR is... I... The, like... The day... After, I guess it was... I stayed the night at Reina's. Um... We were both tired at work, or whatever. And she didn't finish something during the day. And asked me to finish it during the night. I did not finish it. Because it was, like, a pain in the ass. And it was a lot. And, um... Yeah. So, and then I thought... Well, let me at least... Because Reina... Handed the task over with, like... Not, like... This absolutely must-be-done level of urgency. More like, oh, it's something we deal with. She does tend to say things like that. Um... So, maybe she just wasn't communicating directly. Anyway... I saw... I'll proactively contact the person who's opening the next morning. So they'll, you know... Know what's going on. And then... It was... A, the wrong person.

The only missed the last text is about... You know, the neighbor and... Whatever. So, basically, like... A person... Who is my neighbor for, like, 10 years came into the lunch mat and... Looked for me, but inadvertently, like... Testified to my character, I guess. Um... So that's what that was about. But no, this is the latest thing. I was... I kind of... As I mentioned in the text... I wrote and deleted an apology. Because, like, I... In the case that it was going to, like, blow over... Which it is going to blow over, but, like... If it was going to be a nothing murder... I didn't want to say anything more about it and, like, pick it back up. But, apparently, that's not the timeline, right? So, I... This is how I handled it. What do you think? And I think I'm going to follow up with a thing that says, like... Basically... I don't know if I'm going to say it or just do it, but, like... Do you realize, like... How many things that were off the table before... Like, actually, like... Become now viable because... There's this... You know... Whether or not it's actually a thing and that... She would be mad at me about it, which is... I don't... Um... But now it gives me something to, quote-unquote... Make up for. Meaning... Any number of things that otherwise would have been read as, like, corny... Or, like, you know... Like... If I drew her... I'm not going to do it, but, like... You know... Drawing a picture with her cranes or something... Not... Maybe not... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I drew a picture with it. That's gay. But, like... Just... You know, anything. Um... Or whatever. Any, like... A whole range of gifts and gestures that, like... Otherwise would be, like... Eh. Kind of, like... Try hard or something. But in the context of, like... Oh, you know... I feel bad.

That “can kill them” thing is a spectrum — sometimes it’s lethal in relatively small doses, sometimes it’s mostly diarrhea and a bad day.\n*   **The “random” danger list** comes from species-specific enzyme differences — they literally lack certain liver enzymes we have, so toxins linger and do more damage.\n*   **Weed & pets**: THC can cause ataxia, incontinence, seizures, or coma in dogs/cats if the dose is high enough, but many exposures are just prolonged disorientation. People _do_ get away with it sometimes, which feeds the “it’s fine” myth.
