Drop the `.gguf` into your models folder\n2.  Select it in the UI\n3.  Use `AutoGPTQ` or `llama.cpp loader` backend\n4.  Enable GPU offloading for better speed\n\n* * *\n\n✅ **Bottom line:**\n\n*   **Yes**, you can run it if you have **≥32 GB RAM** (CPU) or **~20 GB VRAM** (GPU)\n*   If you only have 16 GB VRAM, you can still run it with partial GPU offload or CPU assist — just slower\n\n* * *\n\nIf you tell me your exact machine specs, I can tell you _precisely_ whether it’ll run smoothly or be a slideshow.  \nDo you want me to check it against your hardware?","role":"assistant"}]}

Load the model with **llama.cpp loader**\n2.  Set **GPU Layers** to ~20\n3.  Enable **Paged Attention** if supported to help with RAM efficiency\n\n* * *\n\n### 📝 Recommendation\n\nIf you want **better speed on 12 GB**, you might consider:\n\n*   Dropping down to a **Qwen3-Coder 14B** or **8B** quantized model — you’ll get ~3–5× faster output with still strong performance\n*   Or, running the 30B on **CPU+GPU hybrid mode** overnight for longer jobs\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **side-by-side table of Qwen3-Coder sizes vs. your VRAM** so you can pick the best one for speed _and_ quality.  \nDo you want me to make that chart?","role":"assistant"}]}
