Update Your WireGuard Config**\n------------------------------------\n\nWhen you generate/download your WireGuard config from TorGuard:\n\n*   **VPN Server Hostname/IP** → Use `45.128.36.130` instead of `USA-Chicago`.\n*   Keep everything else the same (private/public key, DNS, port 1912, MTU).\n*   This ensures you always connect to the exact server your port forward is tied to.\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\.

Test the Port Forward**\n-----------------------------\n\nOnce connected to your TorGuard WireGuard tunnel:\n\n*   Go to canyouseeme.org, enter **8333**, and check.\n*   It should report “Success” if Bitcoin Core is listening and TorGuard is forwarding correctly.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can write you a **ready-to-import WireGuard config** that’s already locked to this server IP and ready for Bitcoin — so you just drop it in and connect.\n\nDo you want me to prep that config?","role":"assistant"}]}

Generate a WireGuard Config Bound to That IP**\n\n1.  Go to your TorGuard account → **WireGuard Config Generator**.\n2.  Under **VPN Tunnel Type**, choose **WireGuard**.\n3.  For **VPN Server Hostname/IP**, select **Custom** and paste:\n    ```\n    45.128.36.130\n    ```\n4.  Leave **Local Private Key** and **Local Public Key** blank (TorGuard will generate them).\n5.  Set **Port** to `1443` (or whatever you prefer from their allowed list — 1443 is usually stable).\n6.  Pick your preferred **DNS** (Cloudflare is fine).\n7.  Leave MTU as default unless TorGuard told you otherwise.\n8.  Click **Generate Config** and download the `.conf` file.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Import That Config Into TorGuard App**\n\n*   If you’re using the **TorGuard desktop app**:\n    1.  Open the app → go to **Settings** → **WireGuard**.\n    2.  Import the `.conf` you just made.\n    3.  Make sure the profile is named clearly (like `BTC-45.128.36.130`).\n    4.  Select that profile and connect — you should now _always_ have that IP.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Verify the IP**\n\nOnce connected:\n\n1.  Go to `https://torguard.net/whats-my-ip.php`.\n2.  Confirm it still shows **45.128.36.130**.\n3.  This IP should now stay fixed until you delete or change that WireGuard profile.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Port Forward Confirm**\n\n*   Your Bitcoin Core port forward is already active for `8333/TCP` on `45.128.36.130`.\n*   As long as you stay on this WireGuard config, it will remain open.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a **PowerShell script** that checks every minute to make sure your IP hasn’t changed and alerts you if it does — useful if you need “set it and forget it” reliability.\n\nDo you want me to set that up for you?","role":"assistant"}]}

Select **45.128.36.130** in that drop-down.\n2.  Fill in:\n    *   **Port**: `1443` (or your preferred stable port from TorGuard’s list)\n    *   **DNS**: Cloudflare (or whatever you prefer)\n    *   Leave the key fields blank so TorGuard generates them.\n3.  Click **Generate Config**.\n4.  Import that config into your TorGuard app and connect using it.\n\nOnce connected, your VPN IP should stay **45.128.36.130** every time, which keeps your Bitcoin Core port forward stable.\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a **quick PowerShell one-liner** that will confirm the IP matches 45.128.36.130 every time you connect.
