So, like, because, like, certain ones, it's almost like the Ruliad in the sense that, like, a lot of them will drive quickly to darkness or light or just one pure color, right? Because, like, they'll just wash out or something. And then some of this depends on, you know, the dynamics are different at different regimes of saturation and, you know, gamma and stuff and brightness. So, like, but there's tendencies out. And basically, like, I got it pretty much mapped out. But, like, the point is, like, this, the items in this table, the fucking, the specific transforms of each time, okay, those are going to be referenced by another table that is going to represent sequences of these, right? Because the sequence is where the real action happens. And then later, we're going to take images and then render the fucking sequences on the images and then store the images or output them. So, basically, I can, like, automate my process because it's, like, it's kind of a fucking huge pain in the ass to do it by hand. I'm going to get fucking, what's it called, carpal tunnel. So, but yeah, so I'm not sure what's the best way to store the sequences. Because they can be variable length. Yeah. So, like, it would be a variable length chain of these type of items, these transforms. Oh, fuck. I forgot there's also sharpness. Hold on. I got a couple more columns for this transform thing.So there's two more columns that... oh, shit. Okay, so it's called USM space sharpen, and there's two parameters, so I guess like USM... we'll call it... okay, I'm sorry. I'm stumbling around. The new columns are as follows. USM underscore sharpen, as in s-h-r-p-e-n, underscore amount, and that goes from 0 to 100. It's an integer. And then the next one is... you know what? Actually, combine it. So have it be USM sharpen, all one word, U-S-M-S-H-R-P-E-N, and do that for the other prefix as well, and then have it be... so it's USM sharpen, all one word, underscore amount, and then USM sharpen underscore radius. And radius is a real number going from 0.1 all the way up to 50.0. Okay, and... yeah, that's it. And let me come back to you. And then, yeah, so... and then the... there's gonna be another table that is fsviewer underscore transforms sequence, which will then... I'll leave it up to you how you think is best to do this, but like it needs to be able to capture basically sequences of arbitrary length of these transforms, and then have like notes about them, like, you know, comments field pretty much.
