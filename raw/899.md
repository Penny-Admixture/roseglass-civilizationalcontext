Install the Eero App**\n\n*   Download it from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.\n*   Sign in with the Amazon account that’s linked to your Eero system.  \n    _(If you’re not sure which account, check who originally set it up — you’ll need their login.)_\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. Find Port Forwarding in the App**\n\n1.  Open the Eero app.\n2.  Tap the **Menu icon** (top-left or bottom depending on version).\n3.  Go to **Network Settings** → **Advanced Settings** → **Reservations & Port Forwarding**.\n4.  Tap **Add a Reservation** (or \"Add Port Forward\").\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. Add Your Device & Ports**\n\n*   Pick the device on your network from the list (or enter its IP address manually).\n*   Add the internal port (the one the service listens on) and the external port (what the outside world will connect to — can be the same).\n*   Choose TCP, UDP, or both.\n*   Save and apply.\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. Optional — Find Your Public IP**  \nIn PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://api.ipify.org\").Content\n```\n\nThat’ll give you the IP people outside your network would connect to. You’ll use this with the forwarded port.\n\n* * *\n\n**Heads-up:**\n\n*   Since Eero runs on Amazon’s cloud-based control system, you _must_ use the app — there’s no 192.168.0.1 login.\n*   If you don’t see the Port Forwarding menu, make sure your phone is connected to the Eero network and that you have admin privileges on that Eero account.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can also walk you through **finding the local IP of the device** you’re trying to forward to, so you can put the right one in the Eero app. That’s usually the stumbling block.","role":"assistant"}]}

What does that VLAN thing do? Just out of curiosity. And then... So, this was spawned by a discussion with GPT-4 about my Bitcoin wallet. And I need to... let me load it up here. I need to... Okay, where is it at? Hold on, sorry. Okay. So I need to have port 8333 forwarded for my Bitcoin QT wallet. And yeah, can you help me do that? I am pretty dumb with regards to networking. I don't know how to do shit, so... Yeah, keep that in mind.","role":"user"},{"content":"Got it — let’s tackle both parts:\n\n* * *\n\n1\\. **What the VLAN toggle is**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe **Uplink VLAN** option is for advanced network setups where your internet provider (or your building’s network) requires your connection to be tagged with a VLAN ID.\n\n*   **VLAN** = _Virtual Local Area Network_, a way to logically separate network traffic on the same physical connection.\n*   If your ISP didn’t specifically tell you a VLAN ID to use, **leave this off** — turning it on without the right settings can kill your internet connection.\n\n* * *\n\n2\\. **Forwarding port 8333 for Bitcoin Core**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Core listens on **port 8333 (TCP)** so other Bitcoin nodes can connect to you. Without this, your wallet can still work, but you’ll connect outwards only and won’t accept inbound peers — slowing sync and limiting your contribution to the network.\n\nHere’s the step-by-step for Eero:\n\n### Step A — Find your computer’s local IP\n\nWe need to tell Eero which device to send traffic to.\n\n**On Windows (PowerShell):**\n\n```powershell\nGet-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object {$_.IPAddress -like \"192.*\"}\n```\n\nLook for something like **192.168.4.x** — that’s your local IP.\n\n* * *\n\n### Step B — Add the port forward in Eero\n\n1.  In the Eero app, go to **Settings → Network Settings → Advanced Settings → Reservations & Port Forwarding**.\n2.  Tap **Add a reservation**.\n    *   Pick your computer from the device list (should match the name or MAC address — I can help match if needed).\n    *   This will _reserve_ the same IP for your computer so it doesn’t change.\n3.  Once that reservation is created, open it and **add a port forward**:\n    *   **External port:** `8333`\n    *   **Internal port:** `8333`\n    *   **Protocol:** `TCP`\n4.  Save the changes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Step C — Verify it’s working\n\nOnce set up:\n\n*   Restart your Bitcoin Core wallet.\n*   Use a port check tool like https://canyouseeme.org to test **8333**.\n*   If it says \"Success\", you’re publicly reachable.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can help you **match your Windows PC in the Eero device list right now** so we pick the correct target for the port forward. That’s usually the only confusing step.\n\nDo you want me to walk you through finding it in your Eero’s connected devices?","role":"assistant"}]}
