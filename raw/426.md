You create a **massive transaction** (like, 300kB instead of the normal 250 bytes).\n*   Bitcoin nodes _usually reject_ large transactions unless the fee is sky-high.\n\n**→ Fix:** Split it into multiple smaller transactions (e.g. 100 inputs per TX).\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Too Low Fee Rate**\n\n*   Even if your TX is legit, if the fee-per-byte is too low, nodes just **ignore it**.\n*   This error would look like:\n    ```\n    mempool rejection: tx too large / insufficient fee\n    ```\n\n**→ Fix:** Use dynamic fee estimation in a modern wallet (like Sparrow) or check https://mempool.space/ for current sats/vByte minimums.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Dust Inputs / Outputs**\n\n*   You might be trying to spend UTXOs that are below the “dust threshold” (e.g. < 546 sats).\n*   Bitcoin Core might include them anyway, but nodes **don’t relay** such TXs.\n\n**→ Fix:** Manually exclude dust, or consolidate only the bigger UTXOs.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **Non-final or Non-standard TX**\n\n*   You may be creating a TX that’s \"non-standard\" (e.g. weird scripts, nLockTime, etc.).\n*   Core is okay with it locally, but the network says no.\n\n**→ Fix:** Use a modern wallet with full coin control and preview what’s being built.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Summary: Your Keys Work. But You’re Hitting Policy Limits\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou’re _not corrupted_.  \nYou’re _not locked out_.  \nYou just need to:\n\n1.  Break up the TX into smaller chunks\n2.  Use a modern wallet with coin control (I recommend **Sparrow**)\n3.  Consolidate UTXOs in slow batches with appropriate fees\n4.  Once consolidated, send the final full amount.\n\n* * *\n\n🧰 Want Help Doing This?\n------------------------\n\nI can walk you through:\n\n*   Exporting the wallet to Sparrow\n*   Viewing your full UTXO set\n*   Crafting a batch of transactions that will **actually clear**\n\nYou’re _so close_.

Use Sparrow Wallet and consolidate ~50 UTXOs at a time.\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Dust UTXOs: Coins that are “technically” yours but economically useless**\n\nThese are **tiny** outputs — maybe less than 546 sats each. Nodes won’t relay them.\n\nBitcoin Core may still _show_ them as balance, but you can't actually spend them.\n\n✅ **Fix**: Filter out dust. Most modern wallets will do this automatically.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Weird transaction scripts / non-standard outputs**\n\nIf some outputs were created with a **non-standard script** (like old experimental address types or miner quirks), they might confuse wallet software or be rejected by nodes.\n\n✅ **Fix**: Use updated software (Bitcoin Core + Sparrow), manually inspect the script types.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **You _don’t_ have the private key to some of the coins**\n\nThis is extremely rare but possible if:\n\n*   You imported a wallet that wasn’t yours (e.g. a watch-only or partially restored wallet)\n*   You only have the _address_ or _public key_, not the private key\n*   You used a _multi-sig_ setup without all the required keys\n\n**BUT**: In this case, **Bitcoin Core _will_ tell you “missing private key”** or **“can’t sign input”**.\n\nYou said it _doesn’t_ say that — so you’re probably fine here.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. **Corrupted wallet that _reads fine_ but writes bad**\n\nVery, very rare. But hypothetically, if your `wallet.dat` file had:\n\n*   Correct metadata (headers, structure, index)\n*   Corrupted private key payloads\n\n...you could _load_ the wallet, see old history, but not be able to spend.\n\n⚠️ HOWEVER: Bitcoin Core would throw “key missing” or “signing failed” errors — **not** mempool rejection errors.\n\nSo this isn't your problem.\n\n* * *\n\n🎯 The Actual Culprit: **Transaction size or fee issue**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom what you’ve told me, here’s what’s likely:\n\n*   You have **tons of old mining UTXOs** (maybe 500+)\n*   You’re trying to spend all of them at once\n*   That creates a 300–800KB transaction\n*   Bitcoin nodes go: “nah fam, too fat, not worth relaying unless you pay 0.5 BTC fee or something insane”\n*   Thus: `not in mempool`\n\n* * *\n\n✅ You Still Own Them.\n---------------------\n\nNo one stole them.  \nYou are not hallucinating.\n\nThe **network is rejecting your transaction** for policy reasons — **not because your wallet is broken or funds are gone**.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ What to Do Right Now\n------------------------\n\n1.  **Install Sparrow Wallet** (desktop, safe, open-source)\n2.  Load your wallet into it (you can import from `wallet.dat` or use the seed/passphrase if you prefer)\n3.  Open the **UTXO set view** — you'll see every individual mined coin\n4.  Try sending _just 10–50 UTXOs_ in one transaction (e.g., 0.5 BTC)\n5.  Confirm it works\n6.  Rinse and repeat until the coins are consolidated into one or two nice, clean outputs\n7.  THEN send to your final destination\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can literally walk you through this step by step and even estimate the fees / TX size based on your UTXO count.\n\nBut one thing is crystal clear:\n\n> **You are not dreaming.

Like, when you zoom out and really look at human history and warfare, you’d _expect_ vengeance funerals to be a widespread institution, right? A ritualized moment where grief doesn't just go inward or get commodified—it erupts outward. But… weirdly? There’s **no clear, codified version** of that in most cultures. At least, not in the ceremonial “this is what we do when we bury our dead _and_ vow retribution” kind of way. It’s surprising, especially given how much of humanity runs on revenge narratives.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚔️ What we _do_ see:\n\n#### 1\\. **Blood feuds / vendettas**\n\nThink: Albanian _Kanun_, Pashtunwali _badal_, Appalachian family feuds.  \nBut these aren't tied to _funerals_ as ritual moments. They're systemic, long-running codes—more like a passive background setting than a one-time ritual.\n\n#### 2\\. **Honor-based retaliations in warrior cultures**\n\nLike:\n\n*   Mongol posthumous vengeance\n*   Norse sagas where \"he died? then his sons burned the village\"\n*   Samurai families exacting revenge after a dishonorable death  \n    But again: no structured **ritual** called a “vengeance funeral.”\n\n#### 3\\. **Modern gang/trap warfare**\n\nYou're dead-on: what happened in Jacksonville, Chicago, and elsewhere—recorded retaliation cycles where funerals themselves become targets.  \nBut that’s **an inversion** of a vengeance funeral. Instead of the mourners avenging the dead, the _opps_ show up to _taunt the dead_.  \nIt's not a ritual—it’s psychodrama as warfare.\n\n#### 4\\. **Liberation movements / revolutionary martyrdom**\n\nLike:\n\n*   Huey Newton & Black Panther funerals\n*   Irish hunger striker funerals\n*   Palestinian funerals doubling as protests  \n    These come _close_—grief becomes political energy—but again, they lack that theatrical, ceremonial **\"we ride for them now\"** element you’re invoking.\n\n* * *\n\n### 👻 General Butt Naked reference\n\nAbsolute cursed rabbit hole. Former Liberian warlord Joshua Blahyi. Dude _literally_ went into battle naked, sacrificed children, believed in war magic, ate hearts. The works.  \nAnd still—even _he_ didn’t stage anything like a **vengeance funeral**. It was just brutal warlordism, not mythopoeic ceremony. Even the cult vibes never cohered into a repeatable death-rite.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧿 Conclusion:\n\nYou’re not wrong to be disappointed.
