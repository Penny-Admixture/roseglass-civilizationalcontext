So if you were logging your Gemma run today, it doesn’t look like anything was saved **yet** to that folder.\n\n* * *\n\n🕵️ Let’s troubleshoot:\n-----------------------\n\nHere’s what might be going wrong — and how to fix it.\n\n### ✅ 1. **Glyphi may not have written today's log**\n\nFrom the image, Glyphi is running, and “Stop Logging” was clicked. However:\n\n*   There’s no confirmation message in the PowerShell window saying logging stopped cleanly.\n*   Glyphi may not have written to `transcripts/` or used a different folder or temp path.\n\n### ✅ 2. **Logs might be in a different directory**\n\nCheck these other likely paths:\n\n*   `C:\\Users\\llm_development\\Desktop`\n*   `C:\\Users\\llm_development\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`\n*   `Documents\\Glyphi\\logs\\` or similar\n*   Look for folders named `Glyphi`, `chatlogs`, or even `Logs` in `AppData\\Roaming`\n\nAlso try searching:\n\n```\n*.log\n*.txt\nsession_*.*\n```\n\nAnd sort by _Date Modified_ to see what was written **today**.\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 3. **Confirm if the transcript actually started**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the PowerShell transcript:\n\n```\nTranscript started, output file is C:\\Users\\llm_development\\Desktop\\... .log\n```\n\nSo Glyphi is definitely creating `.log` files — but only _up to_ 7/10 in that folder. You may want to look on the **Desktop** or wherever it dumped to by default. If it got cut off before finishing today’s session, it might be partial or lost.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Next Step:\n-------------\n\nWould you like me to walk you through:\n\n*   Writing a little PowerShell or Python script to **find all `.log` files modified in the last 24 hours**?\n*   Or explore what’s inside the existing 7/10 `.log` files to confirm their format?\n\nYou could also upload one of those `.log` files if you want me to parse and extract anything useful. Could help confirm if Glyphi is saving anything helpful at all.","role":"assistant"}]}

Manually force a new log to test\n\nWhile Glyphi is open, try this in the same PowerShell window:\n\n```powershell\nStart-Transcript -Path \"C:\\Users\\llm_development\\Desktop\\glyphi_manual_test.log\"\n```\n\nThen interact with Gemma/Glyphi.\n\nThen:\n\n```powershell\nStop-Transcript\n```\n\nThen go to your Desktop and open `glyphi_manual_test.log`.\n\nThat’ll confirm whether the system **can** log at all right now and whether Glyphi is just failing to trigger it.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ 3. Check and edit `run_glyphi.bat` (if needed)\n\nIf you want, paste the contents of `run_glyphi.bat` here, and I can check if it’s invoking logging correctly.
