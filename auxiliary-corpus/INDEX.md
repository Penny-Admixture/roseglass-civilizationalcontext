## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Same approach as main archive:
1. **Preserve original** - Store complete source document in `/raw/`
2. **Multi-model analysis** - Process with Claude, Kimi, GLM-4, etc.
3. **Comprehensive coverage** - Alignment implications, theoretical contributions, cross-references
4. **Tag everything** - Enable search and discovery
5. **Append-only** - Never delete, only add

## FILE NAMING CONVENTION

**Raw documents:**
- Format: `source_filename.md` or descriptive name
- Lyrics: `lyrics_artist_song.md`

**Analyses:**
- Format: `source_filename_analysis_[model_id].md`
- Model IDs: `claude`, `kimi`, `glm4`, `o1`, etc.

---

## CROSS-REFERENCING

Documents in this corpus should be cross-referenced with main archive entries where relevant. Use entry numbers and titles for clear linking.
