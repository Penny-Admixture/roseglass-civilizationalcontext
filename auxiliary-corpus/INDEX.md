## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Same approach as main archive:
1. **Preserve original** - Store complete source document in `/raw/`
2. **Multi-model analysis** - Process with Claude, Kimi, GLM-4, etc.
3. **Comprehensive coverage** - Alignment implications, theoretical contributions, cross-references
4. **Tag everything** - Enable search and discovery
5. **Append-only** - Never delete, only add

---

## FILE NAMING CONVENTION

**Raw documents:**
- Format: `source_filename.md`
- Keep original filename for traceability

**Analyses:**
- Format: `source_filename_analysis_[model_id].md`
- Model IDs: `claude`, `kimi`, `glm4`, `o1`, etc.

---

## CROSS-REFERENCING

Documents in this corpus should be cross-referenced with main archive entries where relevant. Use entry numbers and titles for clear linking.

Example:
> "This framework relates to mode-switching patterns observed in Entry 018 (LLM Miracle Hypothesis)"

---

## USAGE

**To add a new document:**
1. Upload source to `/auxiliary-corpus/raw/`
2. Analyze with available models
3. Save analyses to `/auxiliary-corpus/analysis/`
4. Update this INDEX.md with entry information
5. Cross-reference with main archive where applicable
