## Lyrics

It's only been a week  
The rush of being home in rapid fading  
Failing to recall  
What I was missing all that time in England  
Has sent me aimlessly  
On foot or by the help of transportation  
To knock on windows where  
A friend no longer live, I had forgotten  

And anywhere I go  
There's always something to remind me  
Of another place and time  
Where love that traveled far had found me  

We stayed outside 'til two  
Waiting for the light to come back  
But hidden talk I knew  
Until you asked what I was thinking  

Until you asked what I was thinking  

Brave men tell the truth  
The wise men's tools are analogies and puzzles  
A woman holds her tongue  
Knowing silence will speak for her  

Brave men tell the truth  
The wise men's tools are analogies and puzzles  
A woman holds her tongue  
Knowing silence will speak for her  

Will speak for her  

And everywhere I go  
There's always something to remind me  
Of another place and time  
Where love that travelled far had found me
