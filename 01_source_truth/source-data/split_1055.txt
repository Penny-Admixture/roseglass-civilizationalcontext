And like, specifically, I want to do things like, it's not mainly to get past the paywall, because I found out that the shit I actually care about is all free, it's only the PDF part that costs money, but like, I want to do things like set the image default size to bigger and stuff.\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-exporter-chatgpt/ilmdofdhpnhffldihboadndccenlnfll?pli=1\n\nLike, you'll notice in the screenshot that it defaults to 800, which is insufficient. And there's no way to change the default. Um, stuff like that, so it really isn't necessarily about the money. It's just like, I want to be able to customize this thing.","role":"user"},{"content":"Perfect — thanks for linking the extension and showing me the UI in your screenshot. That helps a ton.\n\nWhat you want to do (change defaults like the “Image Width: 800” slider) is 100% doable by unpacking the extension, editing its config/JS, and re-loading it unpacked. Here’s exactly how you’d do it on Windows:\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Step 1: Locate and copy the extension\n----------------------------------------\n\n```powershell\n$extId   = 'ilmdofdhpnhffldihboadndccenlnfll'  # from the URL\n$extRoot = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions'\n$src     = (Get-ChildItem -Directory (Join-Path $extRoot $extId) | Sort-Object Name -Descending | Select-Object -First 1).FullName\n$dest    = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE \"Desktop\\chatgpt-exporter-unpacked\"\n\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null\nCopy-Item -Path $src\\* -Destination $dest -Recurse -Force\nWrite-Host \"Copied to: $dest\"\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Step 2: Find where defaults are set\n--------------------------------------\n\nInside `$dest`, look for:\n\n*   `exporting.html` (the UI you showed in your screenshot).\n*   A JS file referenced by it, often something like `exporting.js` or bundled code.\n\nSearch for `800` — that’s almost certainly the default image width.\n\n```powershell\nSelect-String -Path \"$dest\\**\\*.js\",\"$dest\\**\\*.html\" -Pattern '800'\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Step 3: Change the default\n-----------------------------\n\nYou’ll probably see something like:\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById(\"widthSlider\").value = 800;\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nconst defaultWidth = 800;\n```\n\nChange it to whatever you want (e.g., `1200`). You can also set the `min`, `max`, or `step` attributes on the `<input type=\"range\">` in `exporting.html`.\n\nExample edit in `exporting.html`:\n\n```html\n<input id=\"widthSlider\" type=\"range\" min=\"200\" max=\"4000\" step=\"50\" value=\"1200\">\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Step 4: Load your version\n----------------------------\n\n1.  Open `chrome://extensions`\n2.  Enable **Developer mode**\n3.  Click **Load unpacked** → select `$dest`\n\nNow Chrome runs your customized version, and it won’t auto-update from the Web Store.\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Step 5: Optional tweaks\n--------------------------\n\n*   Change **default font size**, **color mode**, etc. in the same way — search for the hardcoded default values (`dark`, `auto`, slider defaults).\n*   You can even hard-wire your preferences in JS so it boots with your setup every time.\n\n* * *\n\n⚠️ Note: This won’t touch the “PDF export paywall” logic (since you said you don’t care), but you’ll have total control over UX defaults like width, font, theme.\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to crack open the `manifest.json` and give you **precise file targets + code snippets to change** for the width slider (and other defaults like color mode), so you don’t have to hunt manually?","role":"assistant"}]}

She's like, oh hey, and uh, now seeing if the check goes up there, because I need to go get my stuff, but it's not, it'll be there till 11, which is, that's a whole logistical nightmare, because the plug is waiting for me at 9, god damn it. God fucking damn it.\n\nOkay, so now I went through an entire nightmare of trouble to get Lois to give me the car and some money before I get my paycheck. Then the fucking plug has his phone off. It's like infinite fucking pain here. So anyway, because Rain is leaving at like 11, I decided I'm just gonna go home and get my printing gun. And so first I had to hook the printer up. Then I couldn't find a USB cord. I couldn't find a power cord. I finally found those at great length, like freaking the fuck out with no way at all. I achieved the goal. I got the printer all hooked up. And, uh, oh, and by the way, first thing in the morning, I called Raina to say hello and stuff. And I told her I had something for her and she seemed excited. Um, and then, and then yeah, so now I've got everything ready. I finally got the files. I got the printer hooked up physically. The computer sees the printer and I go to hit print and it says papers out, but yet there's paper in it. I'm going to send you pictures. Can you tell me what the fuck? Why is it not seeing the paper?","role":"user"},{"content":"You're _so_ close, Penny. I can see exactly what's going wrong, and it's totally fixable. Here's the issue:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 Root Cause:\n\nYour **printer thinks it has A5R (A5, rotated)** paper loaded in the tray…  \nBut you're actually trying to print on **Letter (LTR)** paper, and you’ve _actually_ loaded **Letter-size** paper.\n\nSo the printer throws the error:\n\n> `Load paper.LTR`\n\nIt’s not about the tray being empty—it’s that the **paper size setting for the tray is wrong**, so it thinks the correct paper _isn’t there_.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Fix:\n\nYou need to change the **paper size setting** for **Drawer 1** on the printer itself to match the actual paper you’ve loaded (Letter / LTR).\n\nHere’s how to fix it:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ On the Printer's Touchscreen:\n\n1.  When you see the screen that says:\n    > “Drawer 1: A5R / Plain 2”\n    Tap **“Paper Settings”**.\n2.  For **Drawer 1**, change:\n    *   **Paper Size**: `Letter` (sometimes labeled `LTR`)\n    *   **Paper Type**: Leave as `Plain 2` (this is usually fine)\n3.  Press **OK** or confirm until it accepts the change.\n4.  The warning about loading paper should go away, and the printer will now accept the job.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Optional Tip (to prevent this again):\n\nIf the blue tray guides weren’t adjusted to “LTR” when you inserted the paper, the printer might've assumed it was A5R. Make sure the paper tray guides _match the size_ printed on the tray moldings. It looks like you’ve already got it on LTR based on image #3, but it’s good to double-check.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know once you try this—I'll hang around in case it throws another fit or if you want to test with a blank page. You're doing amazing for setting all this up under pressure.","role":"assistant"}]}
