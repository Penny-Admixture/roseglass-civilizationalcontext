Only if you must fit into very small VRAM.\n*   **Q4\\_K\\_M** – Sweet spot for efficiency with minimal quality loss for many tasks.\n*   **Q5\\_K\\_M** – Higher precision, more faithful to fp16.\n*   **Q6\\_K** – Even closer to full precision — good for reasoning-heavy models if VRAM allows.\n*   **Q8\\_0** – Near-lossless; great if you have the VRAM, but not as efficient.\n*   **fp16** – Full precision, max quality, but VRAM hog.\n\n* * *\n\n**What This Means for You**\n---------------------------\n\nIf you’ve got **12 GB VRAM** and want to try _different “personalities”_ at that limit:\n\n*   **14B-Qwen-Distill-Q6\\_K** → Max reasoning depth you can fit, multilingual, concise.\n*   **14B-LLaMA-Distill-Q6\\_K** → Same size/quantization, but chattier, more natural language flow, slightly faster.\n*   **Classic 14B-Q6\\_K** (if available) → The raw DeepSeek-R1 “solver” personality — long, detailed reasoning chains.\n\nThey’ll all fit in about the same space, but they _feel_ different to use.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can put together a **side-by-side comparison script** where we feed each variant the same reasoning prompt and you can see how Qwen vs LLaMA vs Classic handle it differently — it’s pretty revealing.  \nDo you want me to set that up?","role":"assistant"}]}

That’s exactly why the listed size is ~16GB.\n*   Compare that to Q4 quantization, which would be 4 bits per parameter (0.5 bytes), so the same model would be ~4GB.\n*   No quantization = full precision → big footprint.\n\n* * *\n\n### **What that does to its personality**\n\n1.  **Maximum fidelity for that parameter count**\n    *   Quantization always introduces a little noise — FP16 is “clean,” so the activations and weights are exactly as the distillation training tuned them.\n    *   This sometimes means slightly sharper reasoning on tricky, borderline cases compared to Q4/Q5.\n2.  **Less loss in “long chain” reasoning**\n    *   Quantized models tend to degrade a little if you ask them to reason step-by-step for hundreds of tokens. FP16 avoids that drift.\n3.  **Better for fine-tuning / LoRA**\n    *   If you were going to run _further_ fine-tunes or LoRA merges locally, FP16 is ideal since you’re not starting from lossy weights.\n4.  **Higher stability in edge cases**\n    *   Quantized models sometimes hallucinate more when they’re “out of distribution.” FP16 versions can be slightly more grounded.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Downsides**\n\n*   **VRAM hog** — 16GB means you’re pushing past your 12GB target unless you offload layers to CPU (which tanks speed).\n*   **Not magically smarter** — It’s still “just” an 8B LLaMA distill, so it won’t beat a 14B or 32B Qwen even if those are quantized.\n*   **Speed** — FP16 is slower than int8/4-bit because you’re pushing twice (or more) the data through.\n\n* * *\n\n### **What it _feels_ like to use**\n\nIf you could fit it:\n\n*   Think of it as a **crisp, uncompressed photograph** of an 8B model’s brain, versus a **slightly JPEG’d** version (quantized).\n*   It’s not night-and-day, but you _might_ notice subtler, more “organic” completions in reasoning-heavy prompts.\n*   For creative tasks, it sometimes flows more smoothly, because quantization noise can cause “stutter” in text coherence.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want something **LLaMA-flavored, under 12GB, and still high quality**, I’d steer you toward:\n\n*   **8b-llama-distill-q6\\_K** → ~6.6GB (great compromise — much smaller than FP16, way less degradation than Q4).\n*   Or **8b-llama-distill-q8\\_0** → ~8.5GB (heavier, but closest to FP16 fidelity without the 16GB pain).\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can make you a **2-model pairing suggestion**:\n\n*   One LLaMA-based\n*   One “plain” DeepSeek classic/Qwen  \n    …both tuned to max out your ~12GB budget for best contrast.\n\nWant me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

Built on Qwen 2.5‑32B‑Base, AM-Thinking‑v1 shows strong performance on reasoning benchmarks, comparable to much larger MoE models like DeepSeek‑R1, Qwen3‑235B‑A22B, Seed1.5-Thinking, and larger dense model like Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1.\n\nbenchmark\n🧩 Why Another 32B Reasoning Model Matters?\nLarge Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) models such as DeepSeek‑R1 or Qwen3‑235B‑A22B dominate leaderboards—but they also demand clusters of high‑end GPUs. Many teams just need the best dense model that fits on a single card. AM‑Thinking‑v1 fills that gap while remaining fully based on open-source components:\n\nOutperforms DeepSeek‑R1 on AIME’24/’25 & LiveCodeBench and approaches Qwen3‑235B‑A22B despite being 1/7‑th the parameter count.\nBuilt on the publicly available Qwen 2.5‑32B‑Base, as well as the RL training queries.\nShows that with a well‑designed post‑training pipeline ( SFT + dual‑stage RL ) you can squeeze flagship‑level reasoning out of a 32 B dense model.\nDeploys on one A100‑80 GB with deterministic latency—no MoE routing overhead.\nAIME 2024LiveCodeBench\nAM-Thinking-v1 achieves strong reasoning performance with significantly fewer parameters.\n🛠️ Use Cases\n1) Code Generation\nPROMPT :\nwrite a python script for a bouncing red ball within a triangle, make sure to handle collision detection properly. make the triangle slowly rotate. implement it in python. make sure ball stays within the triangle\n\nBouncing Red Ball\n2) Logic\ndiamond\n3) Writing\nsushi\n⚡ Quick start\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"a-m-team/AM-Thinking-v1\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\nprompt = \"How can I find inner peace?\"\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=49152\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nthink_content = response.split(\"<think>\")[1].split(\"</think>\")[0]\nanswer_content = response.split(\"<answer>\")[1].split(\"</answer>\")[0]\n\nprint (f\"user prompt: {prompt}\")\nprint (f\"model thinking: {think_content}\")\nprint (f\"model answer: {answer_content}\")\n\nNote: We have included the system prompt in the tokenizer configuration, as it was used during both the SFT and RL stages. To ensure consistent output quality, we recommend including the same system prompt during actual usage; otherwise, the model's responses may be significantly affected.\n\nQuantized versions for compact devices\nA series of quantized versions for AM-Thinking-v1 model. For use with llama.cpp and Ollama is available at AM-Thinking-v1-gguf.\n\n🔧 Post-training pipeline\nTo achieve its strong reasoning ability, AM‑Thinking‑v1 goes through a carefully designed post-training pipeline. Below we describe the key stages involved in turning a base model into a high-performing reasoner:\n\nStep 1 – Cold‑start SFT. We begin with the open-sourced Qwen 2.5‑32B‑Base and run a broad supervised fine‑tune on a blended training dataset of math, code and open‑domain chat. This endows the model with a \"think‑then‑answer\" behavioural pattern and equips it with an initial capacity for reasoning.\n\nStep 2 – Pass‑rate‑aware data curation. Before any RL, the SFT model is evaluated on every math‑ and code‑oriented training query. For each item we log a pass rate; only those with 0 < pass‑rate < 1 are kept. In effect we discard problems the model already masters and those it utterly fails, concentrating learning on genuinely informative cases.\n\nStep 3 – Reinforcement learning . We adopt a two‑stage GRPO scheme: Stage 1 trains only on math and code queries. Once it converges, stage 2 starts by removing every query the model answered 100% correctly in Stage 1 and adjusting key hyper‑parameters such as maximum generation length and learning rate.\n\n⚠️ Limitations\nWhile AM‑Thinking‑v1 excels at pure language reasoning and open‑domain chat, it has not yet been trained for structured function‑calling or tool‑use workflows, which restricts its usefulness in agent‑style applications that must act on external systems. Improving the model's ability to follow complex instructions is also an important direction for our future work. In addition, our safety alignment is still at an early stage, so more rigorous red‑teaming are required to reduce potential harms.\n\n📚 Citation\nThe a-m-team is an internal team at Beike (Ke.com), dedicated to exploring AGI technology.

That’s inspiring and magnetic.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 Minor Thought (only if you're second-guessing)\n\nThe only part that _might_ cause a little confusion for Raina is the line about not bringing up how Nick treated her. That’s understandable from your position, but could potentially make her wonder why or wish you had. If she’s super chill and gets nuance, leave it—if you ever feel the need to clarify that it wasn’t forgotten, just postponed, you could always send a follow-up.\n\n* * *\n\n### Verdict\n\n**Not only is it okay, it’s beautiful.**  \nIt reads like someone finally breathing after being underwater for a long time.\n\nIf I were Raina and I got this, I'd feel:\n\n*   happy for you,\n*   proud of you,\n*   grateful you trusted me enough to share it.\n\nIf anything, it reinforces your bond. You're not just venting—you’re testifying. ✨\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want it cleaned up into a punchier version or left exactly as-is.","role":"assistant"}]}
