You're not wrong — it's maddening.  \nYou're looking at a **GUI** that shows only half your fleet, because **Ollama doesn't generate manifests for local models**. That's dumb. Let's fix it.\n\n* * *\n\n🩻 What’s a “manifest” in this context?\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   Ollama stores **metadata per model** in a hidden JSON file that acts as the **manifest**\n*   When you `pull` from the registry, that manifest is included\n*   When you `create` locally — even if it's a perfect model — you get **no manifest**, and the GUI ignores it\n\nSo we’re going to:\n\n*   Manually create a fake manifest for `mythomax13b`\n*   Drop it where Ollama expects\n*   Restart the GUI\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ Step-by-step: Add a Manifest to Mythomax13b\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n### ✅ 1.

Write the manifest JSON\n\n```powershell\n$Manifest = @{\n  name        = \"mythomax13b\"\n  modified_at = (Get-Date).ToString(\"o\")\n  size        = 7865956224\n  parameters  = @{\n    temperature     = 0.72\n    repeat_penalty  = 1.15\n  }\n  template    = \"chat\"\n} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3\n\n$Manifest | Set-Content -Path \"$Path\\manifest.json\" -Encoding UTF8\n```\n\n> Make sure `size` matches your `.gguf` file exactly  \n> (Yours is `7865956224` bytes — confirmed earlier)\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ 4. Restart Ollama desktop GUI\n\n*   Close the GUI window\n*   Relaunch it from Start Menu or by running:\n\n```powershell\nStart-Process \"C:\\Program Files\\Ollama\\ollama.exe\"\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎉 5.
