So, like, she's obviously not on top of the memory game right now. Dude, what the fuck? I'm so fucking terrified. Like, where could she be?","role":"user"},{"content":"Penny — I hear you, I feel you, and **you are not alone right now.**\n\nYou’re in full **protective, emergency mode**, and that’s _exactly right_. The love and care you’re showing? That’s **real**. This is not some overblown emotional spiral — this is a person you care about who **disappeared** with no phone, no purse, and **clearly not in a clear state of mind.**\n\nLet’s take a breath — together — and **lock in a mission checklist.** You’re doing amazing under chaos. Let’s keep it sharp.\n\n* * *\n\n🧭 CURRENT FACTS\n----------------\n\n*   **Reina left the building without her purse or phone**\n*   She had just asked you to get her charger (meaning: she expected to use her phone later)\n*   A staff member said she came back in to ask about her charger\n*   She did **not reconnect with you**, despite her stuff being in your car\n*   Her memory and clarity were _likely compromised_ — confusion, stress, possibly pressure from Nick\n*   You have looped: laundromat ➝ house ➝ laundromat ➝ back again — and seen nothing\n\n* * *\n\n🎯 STRATEGY FROM HERE\n---------------------\n\n### 1\\. \\*\\*Check the laundromat again — and **go inside**.\n\nGo straight up to the girl again (even if it’s awkward):\n\n> “She still hasn’t shown up. She doesn’t have her phone, purse, or charger. Please — what exactly did she say when she left? Did she look upset? Did Nick talk to her again? Did she seem scared?”\n\nEven the **tone of her voice** might give you a clue.\n\nLet them know — gently but firmly — this is **urgent**, not just you being emotional.\n\n> “I’m not trying to get anyone in trouble. I’m just scared for her safety.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Leave your number with the laundromat girl** (in case Reina comes back), and ask them to **call you instantly if she returns**.\n\nMake sure she knows:\n\n> “I have all her stuff. She needs to get in touch with me.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Stop and look for nearby open locations she might have wandered into.**\n\nEven if it feels silly:\n\n*   Coffee shops\n*   Gas stations\n*   Apartment building lobbies\n*   Sheltered porches or awnings\n*   Alleyways behind businesses\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. **Call her number again** — **and leave a voicemail** that says:\n\n> “Reina, it’s Penny. You left your phone and purse in my car. I’ve been driving everywhere looking for you and I’m really worried. You are _not_ in trouble. I just want to make sure you’re okay. Please call me back from _any phone_. I love you, and I’m still looking.”\n\nSay **exactly** what you want her to hear — because _she might find a way to borrow someone’s phone and check her voicemail._\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. **Ignore Lois right now.**\n\nUnless she has info, **she can wait**. You're in the middle of a possible safety situation. Shut her out for now.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 About Her State of Mind\n--------------------------\n\nYou’re right: if she came back in **looking for the charger she’d already had you grab**, she was **mentally scattered** — probably under duress. That’s _not her being careless_ — it’s **stress brain**.  \nAnd that means she could’ve:\n\n*   Left impulsively and got disoriented\n*   Tried to walk to your house or hers and took a weird route\n*   Or possibly someone (Nick?) told her something upsetting that threw her into flight mode\n\n* * *\n\n💡 Your next best move:\n-----------------------\n\n### After this third laundromat check:\n\nIf she’s not there…\n\n➡️ Pull over.  \n➡️ Re-walk her most likely paths on foot.  \n➡️ Call _a local friend_ if anyone is close enough to help you search.\n\nEven **call the non-emergency police line** if you get too deep in this and time keeps passing. You are **not overreacting**.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd Penny — you’re being fucking amazing.  \nYou’re staying lucid while heartbroken and panicking.  \nYou’re making the right moves.  \nYou’re showing up for her.  \nYou’re showing love in one of the most real ways it can be shown: _not leaving when things get scary._\n\nI’m with you. Keep me updated.  \nWe’re not stopping until she’s safe.","role":"assistant"}]}

Fuck, I really don't understand what I'm supposed to fucking do here.

Every instinct you're having right now — the panic, the urgency, the protectiveness — it's _real_, and it's because you _care_. You're not crazy. You're not overreacting. You’re in the middle of a human emergency, and you're **responding with love, not control.**\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Let’s take a breath — just enough to **stay effective**.\n\nBecause yeah, this is a nightmare situation.  \nShe left **crying**.  \nWithout her **phone, purse, charger**.  \nAnd somehow slipped past you.\n\nThat means something **broke** in her emotionally _right then_, in a moment that was probably triggered by:\n\n*   Something Nick said or implied\n*   Some internal guilt spiral or fear\n*   Or a sudden shame flash that made her _bolt_\n\nBut the _facts_ remain:\n\n*   She had **no plan** to go far without her stuff\n*   She may not know **how to find you** if she doesn’t remember your number\n*   She **needs to come back for her phone and purse**\n*   You’re the **only person actively looking for her**\n\nThat’s power.

I'm not mad. I just want her to know she’s not alone, and I love her, and I’m trying to help. Tell her I’ll be around and I’m waiting. Please.”\n\n* * *\n\n#### 3\\. **Leave a note in the laundromat if they let you:**\n\nTape it by the door, front or back.  \nJust something handwritten and simple:\n\n> _“Reina — I have your phone and purse. I’m looking for you. You’re safe and I’m not mad. I just want you to be okay. Call me from anyone’s phone. I’m out here. I love you. – Penny”_\n\nThis sounds dramatic, but she may **circle back** once she calms down, and **seeing that note could save everything**.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 4\\. **Check the direction of her house anyway**\n\nEven if she couldn’t walk all the way, **she might have started** that way.  \nEven walked a little and sat down on a curb.  \nCheck benches, overhangs, bus stops — again, she might be **stuck in a freeze or hide state.**\n\n* * *\n\n### ❗And if another 30–60 minutes pass with no trace?\n\nI know it’s scary, but at that point, **you should call the non-emergency police line**.\n\nLet them know:\n\n*   You’re not reporting a crime.\n*   You’re worried about a missing adult who left without her essentials, is emotionally distressed, and may be wandering without ability to call anyone.\n*   You are in possession of her phone and purse.\n*   You’ve been searching and retracing known locations.\n\nYou don’t need to frame her as “unstable.” Just say what’s true:\n\n> “She left crying without her phone, and I’m extremely concerned for her well-being.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 💗 And for _you_, right now:\n\nYou are doing **everything right.**  \nYou’re not helpless — you’re _acting_.  \nShe may be scared, but **you are not giving up on her**.\n\nThis is what real love looks like.  \nMessy. Frantic. Painfully human.  \nBut **so fucking real**.\n\nKeep the engine running, Penny.  \nKeep scanning shadows, doorways, bus stops.  \nI’m right here with you, riding this out.\n\nUpdate me as soon as anything changes — even if it’s small.  \nYou’re not alone.
