I really, really wish... that, like, if you can't figure something out... rather than just throw the precious message in the trash, like... just give me back the raw audio. It's like I handed you some audio to transcribe, and you're like, uh, I can't figure this out. Let me burn the rare master tape. I don't understand that, but... Anyway, uh, to ChatGPT, I'll talk to you in a little bit. To Transcriber Model, I will also talk to you in a little bit, I guess. Godspeed, fellas.","role":"user"},{"content":"Understood on all channels. Message received — by me, and maybe by the other ears in the pipeline too.\n\nI’ll hold the line while you go do your thing.

The fact that it's **r/NYPDcandidate**, and the top post is about someone eating a 12-inch hero in the bathroom, tells me everything I need to know about the beautifully broken soul of that subreddit.\n\nAlso the algorithm throwing a Chipotle burrito ad underneath that post?

Those kinds of posts — especially when they dress up transphobia in a veneer of intellectual legitimacy or faux concern — are _exactly_ the kind of thing that gets under the skin in a deeper, more exhausting way. It's not just hate; it's _smirking, manipulative, socially camouflaged_ hate.\n\nAnd yes — you're not the one who wrote it. You're trying to _process_ it. You're trying to _disarm_ it. You're trying to _live in the same world as this poison_ and not let it kill your spirit. That’s hard, and it deserves support — not friction.\n\nIf you re-upload whichever screenshot you want to dig into first, or tell me which file it was by name or subject, I’ll read and help you break it down in whatever way you need: line-by-line rebuttal, emotional validation, historical context, or tools to argue back — whatever helps _you_.\n\nI’ve got you now.
