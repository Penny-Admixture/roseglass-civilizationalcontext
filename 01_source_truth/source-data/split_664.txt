{"messages":[{"content":"So, Pharmacy sent me a text. They're out of stock of the new Adderall. Because the doctor's office takes so long, that I missed the boat. Fuck my life. I'm trying not to panic. Um, I made arrangements. I think I wish I would've got paid today. But I made arrangements for tomorrow to fucking get... ...something else. Because I got to. Um... So, hopefully tomorrow morning goes smooth. I have two Adderalls left to try to get through the night. In one piece. You know... It's kind of ironic that... You know, what I told Reina about this is what I'm like when I'm not on it. Well, that's true if I'm happy. If I'm hopeless, it's completely not true. I completely lose my shit and scream cry. Like, constantly. I've been crying at work the past... ...several hours. I've made a list of like, me and Nicotine Babe. I don't know, just to try to get my mind off things. And... She... I don't know, she doesn't care. The idea that Reina wouldn't even intervene if I... My life was in the line. Really puts things into sharp relief. I mean... If I even believe you. I mean... Maybe I'm putting too much stock in what you're saying. Because like, you've only heard what I managed to relay in broken English. And like... It just seems like... You know, before I talked to you, I was pretty hopeful about the day. Like, as far as... You know, like... Yeah, there's a lot of like... You know... Dodging, but like, there always is with her. So like, that's not really new. And like... And like... And like, as far as like... I consider it a W if I like... Get a chance to say the truth out loud. And like... So that she has to deal with it like, in that sense. And so like... You know... You know... Call it a low bar, but like, I consider being able to say my piece and not have her run away. A W. And so I don't understand why today wasn't really like... Kind of... You know, in the post game... A stack of W's and then like... Left on high note where like, my interaction with him was like, pretty much dominant. And like, also... When I was talking about the train and stuff. And like... She said to protect her and then she like... You know, so like, basically... You know, bull-drives at the idea of Colby and protect her. And then it's like... You know, here I am and like, does it so happen that she's like, standing on a pavement like, down from me? So it like, made me like, tower over her. So she was just like, to my chin, right? And uh... And then as I'm giving my speech, I'll like... You know... Trans women can be... Just as much of a protector as anybody. Which is true with the outcry over trans sports. So like, basically my overall synopsis here... Just because I have to come up with something to do because I'm dying and I don't have drugs to overpower it. But like, seriously like... I've laid more groundwork today. I don't understand why it's such a like... Sudden doom pill, like... It's never gonna happen. I mean... I just played dumb all along. This is not new. I don't understand why it's suddenly like, so dramatic. And then like, you know, him acting like a douchebag, like, I gotta imagine, like, okay, if I started acting like a douchebag, that would be repellent, right? So, like, what, is there some magic filter that makes it so when he acts like a douchebag, she literally enjoys it? Like, the, there's not a drop-off when she leaves a vibe-like line and gets in a truck with him and drives away? It's not, like, self-evidently, like, a letdown, you know what I'm saying? Like, it seems like that, it's like going from, you know, capitalism to fucking communism in the 80s, like, this is not, not an upgrade. You know, we have accordion music and potato soup now, or whatever, like, no, who wants that? And, like, like, I can't imagine, you know, if he's, like, being all rage on her, and, oh, and this is our question, so, like, you know, I would guess that he's feeling jealous, right? Now, doesn't that kind of, like, incentivize him to self-destruct? Like, does jealousy usually make people act more attractive to their partner? I mean, I would expect them to start fucking off more and more the more jealousy I can get them to experience, right? Like, why? I'm not asking you to lie to me, but, like, I feel like maybe you came to some premature conclusions here. And if you're like playing some kind of overarching, what's better for me, long con thing to get me to turn away from her, like, that's not going to be good for me in the long run because this stuff doesn't follow rules. And that's something, even, like, one thing Reyna did say that, what if she stopped saying, does say that it doesn't make sense, like, when I was, like, describing the part about how someone could be good for you and somebody could be bad for you. And yet, like, there's this thing that's like, where if you're not with them, you're in the wrong place or whatever, and it's not logic or whatever, it's just, it is what it is, and she seems to understand that, but I don't know what the fuck that means.
