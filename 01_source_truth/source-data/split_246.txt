{"messages":[{"content":"So, like, literally every single of the uncensored local models are all based on LLAMA2? Why do you suppose that is?","role":"user"},{"content":"That’s not just your impression — that’s **exactly** what’s happening. Nearly every uncensored local model in circulation right now _is_ based on LLaMA 2 (especially 13B). And the reason is a mix of licensing, weight quality, model architecture, and ecosystem dynamics.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n* * *\n\n🔓 1. **LLaMA 2 is the “least censored” base with high quality**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Meta (Facebook) released LLaMA 2 under a quasi-open license that **doesn't prohibit uncensored fine-tunes**.\n*   The **base model weights are clean**, powerful, and permissively structured — no “hard-aligned” training like OpenAI’s GPTs.\n*   In contrast:\n    *   **GPT-J/GPT-NeoX**: old, limited architecture.\n    *   **Mistral**: great small models, but less explored in high-end uncensored merges.\n    *   **Gemma**, **Claude**, **Command-R**, etc.: closed weights or hard-aligned.\n\nSo, LLaMA 2 became the de facto standard for **DIY rogue LLMs**.\n\n* * *\n\n🛠️ 2. **It’s easier to LoRA/fuse/merge LLaMA 2**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   The tooling ecosystem (LazyMerge, MergeKit, LoRA finetuning) matured _around_ LLaMA 2 first.\n*   Merge recipes like:\n    *   MythoLogic + Chronos + WizardLM → MythoMax\n    *   Chronos + Hermes → Chronos-Hermes\n    *   Psyfighter + OpenOrca + Unsensored datasets\n*   HuggingFace exploded with **uncensored merges** using LLaMA 2 as the spine because:\n    *   The attention architecture is friendly.\n    *   GGUF formats work out-of-the-box with llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, Ollama, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n📦 3. **You can run LLaMA 2 locally at 13B and still get spicy**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   It hits a local sweet spot:\n    *   Smart enough to reason.\n    *   Light enough to quantize (Q4\\_K\\_M etc.).\n    *   Can be uncensored without triggering legal scrutiny.\n*   Meta didn’t bake in safety layers the way GPT-3.5/4 or Claude does.\n*   That’s why **all the naughty/freethinking/oracle-style personalities** you want are riding LLaMA 2 backbones.\n\n* * *\n\n🚫 Why not newer stuff?\n-----------------------\n\n*   **LLaMA 3**: Not truly open. Meta added strict usage clauses & alignment layers.\n*   **GPT-4/Claude**: Closed weights.\n*   **Mistral**: While it's open and strong, it only recently got 13B+ variants with full enough context to match LLaMA 2.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Summary\n----------\n\n> LLaMA 2 is the _last powerful open-ish model_ that’s both **uncensored-capable** and **architecturally flexible** for local use. That’s why nearly all rogue, poetic, or unfiltered local models use it as their spine.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want something **not LLaMA 2–based** but still unfiltered, you could look at:\n\n*   **Mistral 7B + Hermes / OpenHermes / Chronos** (some poetic, edgy vibes at lower VRAM)\n*   **Falcon 180B** (open but too big for local)\n*   **Experimental Mixtral merges** — just emerging\n\nBut as of now?  \n💀 **LLaMA 2 13B** is the uncensored king for local psychonauts, chaos paladins, and techno sorcerers.\n\nWant a list of _non-LLaMA2 uncensored models_ that are even worth touching?
