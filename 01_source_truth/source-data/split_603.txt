Open **PowerShell as Admin**\n2.  Run:\n\n```powershell\nGet-AppxPackage *python* | Remove-AppxPackage\n```\n\nAnd similarly:\n\n```powershell\nGet-AppxPackage *powershell* | Remove-AppxPackage\n```\n\n(If they throw errors, they’re probably already gone — that’s okay.)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧼 Bonus: Fix PATH Priority (for Good Measure)\n\nOnce the junk’s cleared:\n\n1.  Go to:\n    ```\n    Settings → System → About → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables\n    ```\n2.  Under **System Variables**, edit `Path`\n3.  Move your real Python path (like `C:\\Python312\\`) **above** anything sketchy or store-related.\n\n* * *\n\nOnce that’s done, run:\n\n```powershell\nwhere python\nwhere pwsh\n```\n\nThose should now point to your **real** installed binaries — not stubs.\n\nLet me know what `where python` shows after cleanup and I’ll help patch the rest.","role":"assistant"}]}

Otherwise—green light.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Step 2: Fix PATH If Needed\n\nIf `python` doesn’t resolve _at all_ now, it means the real Python isn’t in your system PATH. Let’s add it:\n\n1.

It should look like:\n    ```\n    C:\\Users\\development\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3132\\\n    ```\n    Also copy the `Scripts\\` subfolder path:\n    ```\n    C:\\Users\\development\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3132\\Scripts\\\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n2.  **Add both to system/user PATH:**\n    *   Right-click **Start** → System → **Advanced system settings** → Environment Variables\n    *   Under **User variables for development**, find `Path`, click **Edit**\n    *   Add those two lines (adjusted for your folder name):\n        ```\n        C:\\Users\\development\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3132\\\n        C:\\Users\\development\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3132\\Scripts\\\n        ```\n\n* * *\n\n3.  **Restart PowerShell**, and try again:\n    ```powershell\n    where python\n    where python3\n    python --version\n    pip --version\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n### Bonus (if still weird):\n\nAlso run:\n\n```powershell\nGet-Command python\n```\n\nThat will tell us **exactly** what stub/alias it's invoking.\n\nLet’s **fully liberate** you from ghost Pythons.
