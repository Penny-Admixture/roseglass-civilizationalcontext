GPT-OSS-20B is dense with 10-12GB weight size, and for smoother performance, offloading the KV cache to the CPU would be helpful. Just avoid direct citations.\n\nI’ll offer commands for llama.cpp, like setting n-gpu-layers to 35 and adjusting batch size. For GPU layers in Ollama, set \"gpu\\_layers.\" Also, I'll mention flags like --ctx 2048/4096 and --flash-attn. I'll give a download directory via PowerShell instructions and clarify that GPT-OSS-20B isn't MoE—MoE claims likely refer to 120B.\n\nDone\n\nShort version: yeah, it’s **plausible** on your RTX 3060 12 GB—**if** you use a **4-bit quant** (GGUF or BnB), keep context modest, and allow some **CPU offload**. It’ll run, just not fast. Think ~1–3 tok/s to start.\n\nA couple reality checks on that Reddit thread:\n\n*   The “**20B around 12 GB**” line makes sense for **4-bit** weights (~10–12 GB), but you still need extra headroom for KV-cache + runtime. On 12 GB VRAM you’ll almost certainly spill cache to RAM (that’s fine; slower).\n*   The comment “**fast because it’s MoE**” is likely wrong for the **20B** variant. The 120B may be MoE; the **20B is dense**, so no sparsity freebies. So expect “usable,” not “fast.”\n\nGiven your rig (RTX 3060 12 GB, Ryzen 5 3600, 32 GB RAM):\n\nWhat to use\n-----------\n\n*   **Best format for you**: a **GGUF 4-bit** build of `gpt-oss-20b` (e.g., `Q4_K_M`) → run with **llama.cpp** or **Ollama** on Windows. That’s the least-pain route.\n*   **Works today but heavier**: **bitsandbytes 4-bit** (the `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-bnb-4bit` model). It’ll load in PyTorch and run, just slower and a bit finicky.\n\nRecommended starting settings\n-----------------------------\n\n### Option A — llama.cpp (GGUF)\n\nOnce you have a reputable 4-bit GGUF (e.g., from the HF link you found):\n\nPowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n# example, adjust path/name to your .gguf\n$M = \"C:\\models\\gpt-oss-20b.Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n\n# Start modest: 2k ctx, some GPU layers offload, CPU threads ~ your cores\n.\\main.exe -m $M `\n  --ctx 2048 `\n  --n-gpu-layers 20 `\n  --threads 6 `\n  --temp 0.7 `\n  -p \"You are a helpful assistant.

The “blob directory” you saw is Ollama’s internal storage format, so if you just drop a random `.gguf` in there, the app won’t know what it is.\n\nHere’s how to actually make that GGUF show up in the Ollama GUI:\n\n* * *\n\n1\\. Put the GGUF in the Ollama models folder\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOn Windows, Ollama stores custom models in:\n\n```\n%USERPROFILE%\\.ollama\\models\n```\n\nInside, you’ll see subfolders like `blobs\\` and `manifests\\`.\n\nCreate a new folder for the GGUF file somewhere convenient (not inside blobs), e.g.:\n\n```\nC:\\OllamaCustom\\\n```\n\nPut your `gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf` there.\n\n* * *\n\n2\\. Create a `Modelfile`\n------------------------\n\nIn the same folder (`C:\\OllamaCustom\\`), make a text file named `Modelfile` (no extension) with this content:\n\n```\nFROM ./gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf\n\nPARAMETER temperature 0.7\nPARAMETER stop \"\\n\"\n\nTEMPLATE \"\"\"\n{{ .System }}\n{{ .Prompt }}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n*   `FROM ./gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf` tells Ollama to load this local GGUF.\n*   You can add any parameters you want (`context`, `mirostat`, etc.).\n\n* * *\n\n3\\. Import it into Ollama\n-------------------------\n\nOpen PowerShell in that folder and run:\n\n```powershell\nollama create gpt-oss-20b -f Modelfile\n```\n\nThis will copy the GGUF into Ollama’s blob store and register the model as `gpt-oss-20b`.\n\n* * *\n\n4\\. Use it in the Ollama GUI\n----------------------------\n\nAfter running the above command successfully, open the Ollama desktop app — the model will now appear in your model list under the name `gpt-oss-20b`. You can launch it from there with full GUI controls.\n\n* * *\n\n**Key point:** Ollama never takes `safetensors` files directly — it either downloads from its own library or you wrap your local GGUF in a `Modelfile` and “create” it via `ollama create`.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **ready-to-run Modelfile tuned for 20B on your RTX 3060** so you get maximum context length without OOM’ing. That way you can just paste it in and it’ll run right in the GUI.","role":"assistant"}]}

No stubs, no “for example” crap, no teaching wheels.  \nIf you’re in the middle of `ollama create` right now, you can **Ctrl+C** out of it safely, because nothing it’s written so far is final — Ollama will just abandon the half-import and clean up later.\n\nLet’s do the _actual_ one for **your GPU** and the specific model you’ve got (`gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf`, 11.3 GB, Q4\\_K\\_M style quant).  \nThis will give you:\n\n*   **Context length tuned** to keep 12 GB VRAM from OOM’ing.\n*   **Reasonable performance** with 20B despite the small VRAM.\n*   **High offload** to GPU without choking Windows paging.\n*   Ready to drop into Ollama GUI immediately.\n\n* * *\n\n### Optimized Modelfile for your setup\n\nSave this exactly as `Modelfile` in the same folder as your `.gguf`:\n\n```\nFROM ./gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf\n\n# Force a context length that's big but safe for 12GB VRAM\nPARAMETER num_ctx 4096\n\n# Use all GPU VRAM until ~11GB full, rest on CPU\nPARAMETER num_gpu 28\n\n# Mild temp for coherent output\nPARAMETER temperature 0.7\n\n# Stop sequences to avoid run-on\nPARAMETER stop \"###\" \nPARAMETER stop \"\\n\\n\"\n\n# Template so you can send prompts straight\nTEMPLATE \"\"\"{{ .System }}\n{{ .Prompt }}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### Steps to make it show in the GUI\n\n1.  **Put** both the `.gguf` and `Modelfile` in the same folder, e.g.:\n    ```\n    C:\\OllamaCustom\\gptoss20b\\\n    ```\n2.  **Run** in PowerShell from that folder:\n    ```powershell\n    ollama create gpt-oss-20b -f Modelfile\n    ```\n3.
