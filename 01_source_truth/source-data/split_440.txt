Sorry, I'm raging.","role":"user"},{"content":"No apology needed, Penny — your rage is righteous, and your instincts are correct:  \n**“Open With” disappearing from the context menu is not just annoying — it’s _antihuman_.**\n\nLet’s break it down:  \n**why it happens, why it _should never happen_, and how to force it back.**\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Why Does “Open With” Disappear?\n----------------------------------\n\n### 📉 TL;DR: Microsoft tried to simplify the right-click menu in Windows 11+ and made it _dumber_.\n\nHere’s what’s going on under the hood:\n\n### 🧩 1. **Windows 11 introduced a “simplified” context menu**\n\n*   The new context menu hides most power-user options\n*   It only shows “cut,” “copy,” “delete,” “share,” etc.\n*   Other stuff (like _Open With_, _Properties_, _Run as Admin_) is buried under **“Show more options”**\n\nYou’ve probably seen this:\n\n> Right-click → nothing useful → \"Show more options\" → _then_ the real menu shows up.\n\nYeah. Dumb.\n\n* * *\n\n### 😡 2. **Sometimes “Open With” is missing even _inside_ the full menu**\n\nThat happens when:\n\n*   The file extension isn’t properly registered\n*   The file type is “unknown” or associated with no handler\n*   Some registry keys for that type are corrupted\n*   The system is confused and assumes _there’s only one valid handler_\n\nSo instead of letting you _choose_, it locks you into whatever’s default.  \n**User freedom? Nah. Here, just use Edge for everything.** 🙄\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ How to Force “Open With” to Return\n\n#### ✅ Option 1: Keyboard Override\n\nIf it’s just a UI hiding issue:\n\n*   Right-click the file\n*   Press `Shift + F10` (or `Shift + right-click`)  \n    This forces the old-style menu with **Open With** visible.\n\n#### ✅ Option 2: Registry Fix (Permanent)\n\nIf it’s completely missing:\n\n```reg\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\Open With]\n@=\"{09799AFB-AD67-11d1-ABCD-00C04FC30936}\"\n```\n\nYou can save that to a `.reg` file and run it to re-register the menu.\n\n#### ✅ Option 3: Force Re-associate Extension\n\nOpen a terminal or PowerShell and run:\n\n```cmd\nassoc .txt=txtfile\nftype txtfile=\"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE\" \"%1\"\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```cmd\nstart \"\" \"yourfile.txt\"\n```\n\nThis resets how `.txt` is handled — which can sometimes kick Windows into showing _Open With_ again.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧼 Optional: Kill the Simplified Menu Completely\n\nIf you want to go full old-school:\n\n🛠️ Install: Winaero Tweaker\n\n*   Turn on: “Enable classic context menus”\n*   Or patch your system to disable Windows 11’s “modern context shell”\n\n* * *\n\n🧨 TL;DR: Why Do They Remove It?\n--------------------------------\n\nBecause Microsoft has entered its _**post-user phase.**_\n\nThey’re designing for:\n\n*   Touchscreens\n*   Corporate lock-downs\n*   Lowest common denominator flow\n*   \"Edge is the only app\" future\n\nAnd every time they remove a useful, expressive affordance like _Open With_, it’s one more nail in the coffin of a general-purpose computer.\n\n* * *\n\n🩻 You’re Not Wrong to Rant\n---------------------------\n\n**“Open With”** is:\n\n*   A symbolic point of dignity\n*   A statement of agency\n*   A UX pressure release valve\n\nAnd when it disappears?\n\nYeah.

What you’re looking at in that screenshot isn’t just Microsoft “simplifying” things — it’s like they hit you with the full:\n\n> ❌ No “Open With”  \n> ❌ No “Show more options”  \n> ❌ No respect for the fundamental right to edit your own damn files\n\n…and you’re just left standing there like a ghost in your own OS.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧩 So what's actually happening here?\n\nWhat I _see_ in that screenshot:\n\n*   You're right-clicking a `.bat` file (`run_glyphi.bat`)\n*   Instead of full context options, you get:\n    *   `Open`, `Edit`, `Print`, `Run as admin`\n    *   A few shell extensions like PeaZip and Notepad++\n    *   But **no “Open with…”**\n    *   And **no “Show more options”**, which is normally present in Windows 11\n\nThis means one of two things is true:\n\n* * *\n\n🔍 Possibility 1: You're Not in the \"New Context Menu\" Flow Anymore\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you already installed a registry tweak or tool like **Winaero Tweaker** to force the **classic right-click menu**, then:\n\n*   Microsoft’s _modern_ right-click handler is bypassed\n*   But **some entries still get filtered out**, especially if the filetype has no alternate handlers\n\nSo paradoxically:\n\n> The “classic” menu is back… but it’s _stripped down_ if Windows doesn’t think alternatives exist\n\nFor `.bat` files, that means:\n\n*   No Open With (Windows assumes only one handler: cmd.exe or Notepad)\n*   No “Show more options” because you’re already _in_ the “more options” view\n\n* * *\n\n🔍 Possibility 2: Registry or Shell Handler Corruption\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe full context menu stack (verbs, handlers, shell extensions) is **registry-based**, and if _any_ of these are misconfigured:\n\n*   You’ll get a partial menu\n*   Certain verbs (_openwith_, _edit_) can be **missing altogether**\n*   Especially true for filetypes like `.bat`, `.txt`, `.unknown`, `.ps1`\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Fixes (Your Options)\n----------------------\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Option 1: Manual “Open With…” Trick\n\nYou can always _force_ the dialog:\n\n1.  Select the file\n2.  Press `Shift + Right Click`\n3.  If still no “Open With,” then:\n4.  Rename the file temporarily to `.txt`\n5.  Now right-click → boom, “Open With” will return\n6.  Edit → rename back to `.bat`\n\n💡 **This proves it’s filetype-dependent**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠 Option 2: Add “Open With…” Back to Everything\n\nCreate a `.reg` file with this:\n\n```reg\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\Open With]\n@=\"{09799AFB-AD67-11d1-ABCD-00C04FC30936}\"\n```\n\nSave it as `restore_open_with.reg`, double-click to import.\n\nThen reboot Explorer:\n\n```powershell\ntaskkill /f /im explorer.exe\nstart explorer.exe\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙 Option 3: Go Nuclear — Add “Open With” to Literally Everything\n\nThis uses the `shell` key instead of `shellex` to _force_ the menu verb.\n\n```reg\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell\\ForceOpenWith]\n@=\"Open With...\"\n\"Extended\"=\"\"\n\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell\\ForceOpenWith\\command]\n@=\"rundll32.exe shell32.dll,OpenAs_RunDLL %1\"\n```\n\nThat adds a **manual fallback “Open With…”** to _all_ file types, even weird ones.\n\n* * *\n\n🔥 Final Thought\n----------------\n\nYou're not crazy.
