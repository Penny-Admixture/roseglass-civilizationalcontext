{"messages":[{"content":"I think I have a DigitalOcean droplet that I'm not using for anything. Can we use it? Can we do it with that?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes — a spare DigitalOcean droplet is _perfect_ for this.  \nWe can set it up as a **reverse tunnel** so all your inbound traffic goes:\n\n```\nInternet → Droplet (public IP) → Your home PC\n```\n\nThis completely bypasses Metronet’s CGNAT for free.\n\n* * *\n\nHow We’d Do It\n--------------\n\n### **1\\. Requirements**\n\n*   Your DigitalOcean droplet should have:\n    *   A public IPv4 address (all DO droplets do by default)\n    *   SSH access\n*   Your home PC needs to be able to initiate outgoing SSH to the droplet (CGNAT doesn’t block this)\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. The Core Idea**\n\nWe’ll use **SSH remote port forwarding** (or WireGuard if you want it permanent) so:\n\n*   Bitcoin Core (port 8333) and Minecraft (e.g., 25565) appear open on your droplet\n*   Traffic on those ports is tunneled back to your PC\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Quick SSH Tunnel Example**\n\nOn your PC (PowerShell), you’d run:\n\n```powershell\nssh -N -R 8333:localhost:8333 -R 25565:localhost:25565 youruser@your_droplet_ip\n```\n\nThis means:\n\n*   Anyone connecting to your droplet’s port 8333 → goes to your PC’s 8333 (Bitcoin Core)\n*   Anyone connecting to droplet’s port 25565 → goes to your PC’s 25565 (Minecraft)\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Persistent Setup**\n\nIf you want it to run 24/7:\n\n*   We can make a systemd service on the droplet to keep the tunnel alive\n*   Or run **autossh** on your PC so it auto-reconnects\n*   Or go bigger: install **WireGuard** so your home PC is permanently on the droplet’s LAN\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. Why This Works**\n\nMetronet’s CGNAT only blocks _inbound_ connections to your home.  \nBut when your PC opens an outbound SSH or VPN to your droplet, that tunnel stays open — so the droplet can send traffic right back down it.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you **the exact commands** to:\n\n*   Enable the ports on your DigitalOcean droplet\n*   Run the SSH tunnel\n*   Keep it alive so Bitcoin Core & Minecraft are always reachable\n\nDo you want me to give you the **SSH-tunnel version** (fastest to set up) or the **WireGuard permanent version**?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Well, actually, one other thought in terms of converting this into an sneaky funding thing. Is there a VPN that I can charge to my Apple, like, I mean, basically, like, App Store?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yep — there are several legit VPNs that **support in-app subscriptions through the Apple App Store** so it would just show up as an Apple charge, and you could pay with whatever payment method you already have tied to your Apple ID.\n\nIf you want one that also supports **port forwarding** (for Bitcoin Core, Minecraft, etc.), the list is smaller — most mobile-focused VPNs don’t bother with that feature.\n\n* * *\n\n🔹 VPNs You Can Pay for via the App Store\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### **1\\. PureVPN**\n\n*   Has an iOS app with in-app purchases via the App Store.\n*   Port forwarding is an add-on you can enable in settings.\n*   Not as hardcore-privacy-minded as Mullvad/AirVPN, but works fine for game servers & Bitcoin.\n\n### **2\\. Private Internet Access (PIA)**\n\n*   iOS app supports App Store billing.\n*   Port forwarding available on specific servers.\n*   Very solid network; one of the more reputable “big” VPNs.\n\n### **3\\. ProtonVPN**\n\n*   iOS app with Apple billing option.\n*   Port forwarding on **Plus** or **Unlimited** tiers.\n*   Very transparent about privacy and infrastructure.\n\n* * *\n\n⚠️ Big Note\n-----------\n\nMullvad and AirVPN — the two _best_ port-forwarding VPNs — **do not** sell through the App Store. You’d have to buy directly from them.\n\n* * *\n\nRecommendation\n--------------\n\nIf the priority is “pay through Apple so it doesn’t show as a VPN purchase on a bank statement,” then:\n\n*   **PIA** is the safest middle ground — supports port forwarding, stable speeds, and you can manage it all from their iOS app.\n*   **ProtonVPN** is the most reputable in terms of privacy, but you’ll want to confirm the exact port-forwarding limits.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can narrow this down to **the one with the simplest port-forward setup for Bitcoin Core** so it’s basically “install → tap → done” without extra config.

Could I... shit like that?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — if you go with **Private Internet Access (PIA)** through the App Store _and_ use their port forwarding feature, you can absolutely do all of that:\n\n*   **Bitcoin Core node** → works fine over forwarded TCP 8333.\n*   **Minecraft server** → works fine over forwarded TCP 25565 (and UDP if needed).\n*   **Expose local LLMs to the internet** → you can have your own iOS app connect directly to your home machine via your PIA-assigned public IP + forwarded port.\n*   **Custom services** → any TCP/UDP service listening on your PC can be made reachable.\n\n* * *\n\nHow it would work with PIA\n--------------------------\n\n1.  **Install PIA via App Store** (so it bills through your Apple ID).\n2.  In the PIA app, pick a **server that supports port forwarding** (PIA marks these in their location list).\n3.  Turn on port forwarding in settings.\n4.  Once connected, PIA gives you a **specific port number** (different each time unless you use their automation API).\n5.  In your router or PC firewall, forward that port internally to your local service (or just have the service listen directly on that port).\n\n* * *\n\nExample: Minecraft\n------------------\n\n*   PIA assigns you public IP `203.x.x.x` with port `49234`.\n*   In Minecraft server config, set `server-port=49234`.\n*   Friends connect to: `203.x.x.x:49234`.\n\n* * *\n\nExample: Your Own LLM iOS App\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  Run your LLM’s API server locally (e.g., on port 5000).\n2.  PIA gives you port `51111`.\n3.  Use something like **Caddy** or **Nginx** locally to reverse-proxy `51111` → your LLM API.\n4.  In your iOS app, hit `http://<pia_public_ip>:51111` from anywhere.\n\n* * *\n\nPros\n----\n\n*   Zero CGNAT issues — your public IP is from PIA, not Metronet.\n*   Works for _any_ protocol that PIA allows (most TCP/UDP).\n*   No static IP fee from Metronet.\n\nCons\n----\n\n*   PIA’s forwarded port changes unless you script their API to fetch it and update configs.\n*   You have to be connected to the VPN for inbound to work — if you disconnect, services go offline.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **one-time setup** where:\n\n*   PIA auto-connects on boot\n*   Windows firewall rules are set for Bitcoin, Minecraft, and your LLM server\n*   You have a PowerShell script that grabs the PIA port and updates configs automatically\n\nThat would make it “set and forget” — you’d just give people your current PIA IP:Port when you want them to connect.\n\nDo you want me to prep that setup?","role":"assistant"}]}

In your TorGuard iOS app or desktop client, add a **New Server**:\n    *   **IP Address**: Your static IP from TorGuard\n    *   **Protocol**: WireGuard (best speed/latency)\n2.

Rock-Solid Stability**\n----------------------------\n\nBecause you have:  \n✅ Static IP  \n✅ Permanent port forwarding  \n✅ WireGuard auto-connect set to “Always”  \n…everything will “just work” without you having to check/change IPs or ports again.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can put together **a single network diagram + PowerShell config script** for your PC so Bitcoin, Minecraft, and your LLM API all run behind the TorGuard static IP and auto-start every time your computer boots.\n\nDo you want me to prep that?

Request the Port Forward from TorGuard**\n\n1.  In the **Port Forward Request** screen you showed:\n    *   **Protocol:** Select `TCP`.\n    *   **Port:** Enter `8333`.\n    *   **IP Address:** Choose the same VPN endpoint you’ll actually connect to (e.g., `USA-Chicago`) — this must match exactly in your VPN config.\n    *   Leave other fields as-is unless TorGuard’s instructions say otherwise.\n2.  Submit the request and note the “Port/Auth” details and the **VPN Server IP** TorGuard gives you after approval.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Generate Your WireGuard Config**\n\n1.  In the **WireGuard config** screen:\n    *   **VPN Tunnel Type:** `WireGuard`.\n    *   **VPN Server Hostname/IP:** Match the same city/server from Step 1.\n    *   You can let TorGuard auto-generate keys (leave the key fields empty).\n    *   **Port:** Usually leave as default unless TorGuard says otherwise.\n2.  Generate the config and download it — this will give you the exact WireGuard setup for your client.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Apply the WireGuard VPN on Your Machine**\n\nSince you’re on Windows, you’ll use the **WireGuard client**:\n\n1.  Install WireGuard for Windows.\n2.  Import the `.conf` file you generated.\n3.  Connect — now your machine will have a public IP from TorGuard.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Set Up Bitcoin Core**\n\nIn `bitcoin.conf` (usually in `%APPDATA%\\Bitcoin`):\n\n```ini\nlisten=1\nport=8333\nexternalip=<Your TorGuard-assigned IP>\n```\n\nReplace `<Your TorGuard-assigned IP>` with the public IP TorGuard shows when connected.\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. Allow Incoming Connections Locally**\n\nRun this PowerShell command to open port 8333 on Windows Firewall:\n\n```powershell\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Bitcoin Core\" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8333 -Action Allow\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### **6\\. (Optional) Configure Eero Reservations**\n\nOn the Eero app:\n\n1.  Go to **Settings → Reservations & Port Forwarding**.\n2.  Create an **IPv4 reservation** for your PC’s local LAN IP.\n3.  Add a **Port Forward**: TCP 8333 → your PC’s reserved IP.\n\nThis step is only needed if the VPN isn’t handling port forward directly — TorGuard’s WireGuard setup _should_ already forward it, but with Eero NAT you sometimes need a matching rule.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can make a **full working config file for WireGuard** based on your TorGuard portal data so you can drop it in and run without guessing settings.\n\nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

That’s fine for privacy, but not great if you want something stable for port forwarding.\n*   If you **enter a specific IP address** here, you’re locking your port request to that exact TorGuard VPN server.\n    *   That means whenever you connect, you must explicitly choose that IP in your WireGuard config (instead of “USA-Chicago” hostname).\n    *   This keeps your public IP _the same_ and keeps the forwarded port tied to it.\n\nFor Bitcoin Core, Minecraft, LLMs, etc., you **definitely** want to request the port for a fixed IP and then always connect to that IP in WireGuard.\n\n* * *\n\n**What I recommend for you**\n----------------------------\n\n1.  Find the **exact server IP** you want from TorGuard’s server list.\n2.  Put that IP into the **IP Address** box in your port forward request.\n3.  Always connect your WireGuard client to that **same IP** (not the generic `USA-Chicago` hostname).\n4.
