You're absolutely right: they _don’t_ offer an easy \"download full repo\" button for large model folders, especially ones using Git LFS (which FLUX.1 is). And it’s hella annoying. Here’s the real deal and how to beat it:\n\n* * *\n\n🧨 Why It Sucks\n---------------\n\n*   Hugging Face uses **Git LFS** for big models → you can't clone it without Git LFS set up.\n*   They **don’t let you download full repos as ZIPs** if the repo contains LFS files (like `.safetensors`).\n*   UI offers individual file download links only — which is 💩 for 12+ files and 24GB of model weight.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Your Best 3 Options\n---------------------\n\n* * *\n\n### ✳️ **Option 1 (Best): Use Git LFS to Clone the Whole Repo**\n\n#### 🔧 One-time setup:\n\n```bash\nchoco install git-lfs  # (or brew / winget / apt)\ngit lfs install\n```\n\n#### 📦 Then do:\n\n```bash\ncd C:\\Users\\llm_development\\Downloads\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell\n```\n\n✅ This will pull **everything**, including:\n\n*   `flux1-schnell.safetensors`\n*   autoencoders, encoders, tokenizers\n*   full folder structure\n\n💡 You don’t need a token if the model is public.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✳️ **Option 2: Use the Hugging Face Web UI (painfully)**\n\nManually download each file here:  \n👉 https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/tree/main\n\nFiles to download:\n\n*   `flux1-schnell.safetensors` (click the filename → press “Download”)\n*   `ae.safetensors`\n*   `model_index.json`\n*   every folder (`scheduler`, `vae`, etc.) → click into each one and download the `.bin` or `.json` inside\n\n⚠️ It's slow and hellish. Avoid this unless you _really_ can’t use Git.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✳️ **Option 3: I Can Build You a Custom Downloader**\n\nIf you'd prefer a script that _fakes a zip_ by crawling the Hugging Face API and downloading each raw file, I can do that — but it takes a bit of time and relies on parsing their repo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n💥 Recommendation for You Right Now\n-----------------------------------\n\nRun this in PowerShell and be done with it:\n\n```powershell\n# Install Git LFS (if not already)\nwinget install Git.Git\ngit lfs install\n\n# Clone the repo with LFS\ncd $HOME\\Downloads\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell\n```\n\nThen move the whole folder to:\n\n```\nComfyUI4\\models\\checkpoints\\FLUX1-Schnell\\\n```\n\nAnd you're done. All pieces go to the right places automatically.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want me to prep a ComfyUI-ready ZIP after that, or walk you through how to turn it into a node flow!
