You're getting:\n\n> `Invoke-RestMethod: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.`\n\nThat tells us **the Node server is either:**\n\n1.  Not running\n2.  Crashed silently\n3.  Listening only on IPv6 or a different interface (e.g. not `127.0.0.1` / not port `3000`)\n4.  Blocked by firewall or security software (again)\n\nLet’s go step-by-step. We’ll run _diagnostics first, no guessing_:\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Step 1: Confirm server is running\n-----------------------------------\n\nOpen a fresh PowerShell tab and run:\n\n```powershell\nnetstat -ano | findstr :3000\n```\n\nThat’ll show if anything is actually listening on port 3000. If it **is**, you'll see something like:\n\n```\n  TCP    127.0.0.1:3000      0.0.0.0:0      LISTENING       <PID>\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```powershell\ntasklist /fi \"pid eq <PID>\"\n```\n\nTo confirm it's Node.js running that PID.\n\n**If nothing is listening**, restart the server manually:\n\n```powershell\ncd C:\\Users\\llm_development\\trustworthy_nondisposable\nnode server.js\n```\n\nWatch for errors. Confirm it says:\n\n> `Web Archiver listening on all interfaces at port 3000`\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Step 2: Confirm curl works on same port\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn another tab, try:\n\n```powershell\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n```\n\nThat should give something like:\n\n```\nCannot GET /\n```\n\nThat's expected—means server _is_ responding.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Step 3: Try the POST again\n----------------------------\n\nNow test:\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3000/archive -Method POST -Body '{ \"test\": 123 }' -ContentType \"application/json\"\n```\n\nStill no luck? Try `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`.\n\nAlso, make sure `server.js` includes this **exact** listener code (IPv4/IPv6 safe):\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.post('/archive', (req, res) => {\n  console.log(\"Received:\", req.body);\n  res.json({ status: 'ok', received: req.body });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => {\n  console.log('Web Archiver listening on all interfaces at port 3000');\n});\n```\n\n* * *\n\n🛡 Bonus Check: Firewall\n------------------------\n\nJust to be sure, run:\n\n```powershell\nGet-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like \"*Node.js*\"}\n```\n\nIf you don't see any `Allow` rule for Node, rerun this:\n\n```powershell\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Allow NodeJS Localhost\" -Direction Inbound -Program \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe\" -Action Allow -LocalPort 3000 -Protocol TCP\n```\n\n(Adjust the `Program` path if Node is installed elsewhere.)\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Summary:\n----------\n\n| Task | Expected Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `netstat` | Shows `LISTENING` on `:3000` |\n| `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/` | Responds with “Cannot GET /” |\n| `Invoke-RestMethod ...` | Responds with JSON |\n| Firewall rule | Allows Node on port 3000 |\n\nOnce we confirm the server is listening and curl is getting through, the POST will follow.\n\nWant me to write you a test client in Python or Node to isolate POSTs separately from PowerShell weirdness?\n\nLet’s nail this.","role":"assistant"}]}
