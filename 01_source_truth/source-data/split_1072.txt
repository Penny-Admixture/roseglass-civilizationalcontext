These files are usually large `.safetensors` blobs, and overwriting them could nuke the O: drive’s copy of that model.\n*   **If filenames are different:** They’ll coexist fine — Ollama doesn’t care if `blobs` contains extra files.\n\n* * *\n\n### Safe merge procedure (no accidental overwrites)\n\n1.  **Stop Ollama** so it’s not writing during the move.\n2.  **Manually merge folders** in File Explorer or with `robocopy` in \"no overwrite\" mode:\n    ```powershell\n    robocopy \"C:\\Users\\llm_development\\.ollama\\models\" \"O:\\ollama-models\" /E /XC /XN /XO\n    ```\n    *   `/XC` = skip files with same contents\n    *   `/XN` = skip newer files in the destination\n    *   `/XO` = skip older files in the destination\n    This ensures nothing in O: gets replaced.\n3.  Once merged, **point Ollama** to O:\\\\ollama-models with:\n    ```powershell\n    setx OLLAMA_MODELS \"O:\\ollama-models\"\n    ```\n4.  **Delete the old C: folder** after verifying Ollama sees all your models:\n    ```powershell\n    ollama list\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want zero risk and **don’t even want to merge files right now**, the easiest trick is to just replace the `C:\\Users\\llm_development\\.ollama\\models` folder with a **junction** to `O:\\ollama-models`.  \nThat way, Ollama still “thinks” it’s using C:, but everything actually goes to O:.\n\nWant me to give you the exact symlink command so you don’t even have to touch the files themselves?

Stop Ollama service**\n\n```powershell\ntaskkill /IM ollama.exe /F\n```\n\n(or close it via Task Manager)\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\.

You handled it exactly right.\n\nYou responded quickly once you saw the missed call, gave a natural and non-defensive reason (“I had headphones on” / “I was writing music”), and checked in with a simple “everything ok?” — which shows care and presence without over-apologizing or spiraling.\n\nIf Reina was reaching out about something important or emotional, she’ll likely appreciate the fact that you followed up so quickly and asked how things were. If it wasn’t urgent, then your response still feels warm and attentive.\n\nThe **vibe** of your message is:\n\n*   accountable ✅\n*   grounded ✅\n*   still open and emotionally available ✅\n\nSo no, it’s not bad that you missed the call — you were in flow state, doing meaningful work — and you responded in a way that kept the connection intact and invited her to talk.\n\nIf you’re feeling unsure or want to signal extra warmth later, you can always follow up with something like:\n\n> “Was just thinking about you — call me when you’re free 💛”\n\nBut honestly?
