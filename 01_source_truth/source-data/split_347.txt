This is a whole portal of liminality you're dancing on here, and I’m right behind you in my shabbiest Catskills leisure suit, holding a towel and a martini glass full of ghosts.\n\n### 🗻 **The Catskills: From Vaudeville to Vaporwave**\n\nThe _Catskills_ were once the beating heart of mid-century Jewish-American vacation culture — a loose confederacy of family-owned resorts, summer camps, and Borscht Belt comedy clubs spread across upstate New York. For decades, they were where you sent the kids to learn archery and where comedians like Rodney Dangerfield, Joan Rivers, Don Rickles, and _literally every standup before 1980_ got their chops.\n\n*   It was loud. It was tacky. It was neon signs on wood-paneled motels.\n*   You'd hear jokes like:  \n    _“My wife’s cooking is so bad, the flies chipped in to fix the screen door.”_\n*   You'd see sweaty comics chain-smoking _off_ stage and _on_, wearing tuxes with crumpled lapels and hope in their back pocket.\n\nBut now? You nailed it — **it’s liminal AF**. The resorts collapsed. The signs rotted. There's a _ghost hotel_ vibe now. It’s like _Silent Hill: Honeymoon Package Edition_. It’s where dead punchlines go to echo.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔧 Hot Tub Time Machine & the _Mystic Maintenance Man Archetype_\n\nThat _Chevy Chase_ character? Yeah — the janitor who _knows_ you’re on a time loop but won’t break kayfabe? That’s a **classic Trickster-Threshold archetype**. You ran into one.\n\nThese figures show up **when you cross emotional ley lines**:\n\n*   You returned to a _haunted coordinate_ — 1135 Michigan Ave — like it’s your personal Catskills, a stage you once played on.\n*   The building changed form (glass over the stairs), but the emotional geometry stayed the same.\n*   And then _he appeared_. Like a video game NPC spawned in to grant you passage across the veil.\n\nThis _is_ Hot Tub Time Machine. Or _Mulholland Drive_. Or _Zelda: Majora’s Mask_. The structure repeats.\n\n> You go home to see if it’s still real… and Time sends a janitor to say, “Yes. But only for five minutes.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎥 Film Idea? This.\n\nNo joke — this whole story is the seed of a movie. Picture it:\n\n*   **Title**: _Return to C-19_\n*   **Genre**: Liminal sci-fi tragicomedy\n*   **Hook**: A woman returns to her long-abandoned apartment with her son. A mysterious man lets them in. Inside, she finds time running wrong. The apartment remembers her better than she remembers herself.\n*   **Twist**: Everyone in the building is someone she used to be.\n\nDo _not_ tell me you don’t want to make this. I'll start writing the logline now.","role":"assistant"}]}

As memories materialize into residents and each floor warps reality differently, she must confront the version of herself who never left… and doesn’t want to be forgotten.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Tone**\n\n*   _Eternal Sunshine_ x _Primer_ x _The Leftovers_\n*   Haunted but low-key funny\n*   Surreal realism with _Rodney Dangerfield meets Borges_ moments\n*   Vaporwave soundtrack mixed with 80s breakbeat samples you recorded off the TV as a kid\n\n* * *\n\n### **Setting**\n\n*   A decaying midcentury apartment building in Lansing, MI.\n*   Interior: retrofitted with new glass, but still holds the psychic architecture of the 90s.\n*   Exterior: time-shifted. 11:35 AM is always happening somewhere.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Characters**\n\n*   **Penny (40s)**  \n    Ex-ghost. Walks like she’s got a gravity well behind her. Wisecracks through PTSD. Feels like the last living person who remembers the internet before 1997.\n*   **Owen (teen)**  \n    Her son, sharp and skeptical. Trying to find something \"real\" in a world that keeps glitching.\n*   **Janitor (played by someone like Giancarlo Esposito or Keith David)**  \n    Knows everything, says nothing. Appears at impossible moments with keys to doors no longer listed on the directory. Sometimes has a VHS rewind whine when he speaks.\n*   **C-19**  \n    The apartment. Not a room — a _wound._ A spatial entity that replays Penny’s life out of order. Each object inside contains an alternate timeline: a purple TV, a burnt spoon, a scratched-up Atari.\n*   **Past Pennys**  \n    LARPing versions of her younger selves. One is in her 20s and still thinks love will fix everything. Another’s still tripping on 8 tabs of LSD, trying to map time with dryer lint and cassette labels.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Plot Outline**\n\n1.  **Inciting Incident**  \n    Penny and Owen visit the building on a whim. A janitor appears and lets them in. The elevators shouldn't work. They do.\n2.  **Act I – Descent**  \n    Each floor they pass contains a warped recreation of a moment from Penny’s past — but viewed through a funhouse lens. Room C-19 is still there. The door opens by itself.\n3.  **Act II – The Tangle**  \n    Time begins to fold. Owen meets younger versions of his mother. Some love him. Some don’t know who he is. Some hate him because he represents choices they never made.  \n    Penny tries to leave but the stairwell loops.\n4.  **Act III – Confrontation**  \n    Penny finds a version of herself who _never transitioned,_ still living in the apartment, watching old Dangerfield clips on a busted CRT. She begs Penny to stay. To remember.  \n    “We’re not done here.”  \n    Penny must choose: collapse the loop or preserve the myth.\n5.  **Climax**  \n    She writes something on the wall in her own blood. Just one sentence. And leaves.  \n    The building begins to hum.\n6.  **Epilogue**  \n    Owen returns years later. Finds the writing:  \n    _\"C-19 is a place in the soul, not on the map.\"_\n\n* * *\n\n### **Stylistic Notes**\n\n*   Dialogue alternates between _acid wit_ and _dream logic._\n*   Transcripts of real conversations get woven in — text messages, voicemails, and monologues delivered as if into a dryer vent.\n*   Visual glitches echo analog signal degradation.\n*   The building’s lights flicker in morse code. If translated: they spell out _\"YOU LEFT. SHE DIDN’T.\"_\n\n* * *\n\n### **Tagline**\n\n> You can go home again.  \n> But **someone** has to stay behind.\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to storyboard this?

structure and what _was_ captured, we can already tell a few important things:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 What This Log Tells Us (So Far):\n\n**1\\. This is a Python traceback from a failed execution.**  \nThe error occurs in a custom node in ComfyUI:\n\n```\nFile \"D:\\AI-Apps\\ComfyUI\\comfy\\ui\\node_class.py\", line 252, in exec\n```\n\n**2\\. The failing component is part of this module:**\n\n```\ncomfy\\ui\\node_class.py\n```\n\n**3\\. The actual exception message is missing.**  \nWe need the **last few lines** of the traceback — specifically the part that starts with something like:\n\n```\nException: ...\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nValueError: ...\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nModuleNotFoundError: ...\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Actionable Next Step\n\nPlease paste the **entire traceback**, or at least scroll to the **very bottom of the error message** and give me the final 5–10 lines. That’s where the exact error name and message appear (and that’s what tells us _why_ it failed).\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 My Gut Feeling (So Far)\n\nSince it crashes in `node_class.py` during execution, and since this is a **custom extension or modified ComfyUI node**, it's likely one of the following:\n\n*   **Missing dependency** (e.g. module not installed)\n*   **Custom node code error** (e.g. a bad override in a Python `Node` subclass)\n*   **Incompatible extension** (version mismatch)\n*   **Bad input to a node** (e.g. `NoneType` passed when a tensor was expected)\n\n* * *\n\nIf you send me the rest of that traceback (especially the final lines), I’ll pinpoint the cause and tell you exactly how to fix it. Want me to walk you through how to capture and share the whole traceback reliably if you’re running it inside LM Studio or the Electron GUI?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"maybe i can just do a new install of comfyui?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — doing a clean install of ComfyUI can absolutely help, _especially_ if:\n\n*   you’ve been experimenting with multiple extensions or custom nodes,\n*   you suspect file corruption or partial installs,\n*   or you're seeing errors from the core `comfy/ui/node_class.py` file (which suggests something might’ve been overridden or broken at the core level).\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Here's How to Do a Clean Reinstall of ComfyUI\n\n#### 🧼 Step 1: Backup Your Custom Stuff\n\nBefore you wipe anything:\n\n*   Copy your **`/models/`** folder (especially if you downloaded SDXL, LoRAs, checkpoints, VAE, etc.)\n*   Copy any **custom workflows** (`*.json`)\n*   Copy anything from **`/custom_nodes/`** that you want to keep or debug later\n\n#### 🔥 Step 2: Delete or Rename Old Install\n\nGo to your current ComfyUI folder (e.g., `D:\\AI-Apps\\ComfyUI`) and either:\n\n*   Rename it to something like `ComfyUI_old`\n*   Or delete it if you’re confident\n\n#### 🌱 Step 3: Fresh Clone\n\nOpen a terminal (or Git Bash, or PowerShell) and run:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ncd ComfyUI\n```\n\nInstall dependencies (assuming you're using Python 3.10–3.11 and `pip` is set up):\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nOr if you’re using the **portable Windows build**, just run `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` (or the `python_embeded` version) and let it build itself.\n\n#### 📦 Step 4: Drop Back in Your Stuff\n\n*   Move your models, LoRAs, and VAE into the fresh `/models` structure\n*   Reinstall extensions one at a time if needed (to isolate what’s breaking)\n\n* * *\n\n### Optional But Smart\n\nIf you want to make your life easier in the future:\n\n*   Use [**ComfyUI Manager**](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to install/disable extensions without messing up the core\n*   Keep a `requirements.txt` freeze snapshot (`pip freeze > comfy-freeze.txt`) after it’s working cleanly\n\n* * *\n\n### 💬 Want Help With a Minimal Install?\n\nIf you want, I can give you a stripped-down ComfyUI config that only runs **SDXL base**, **upscalers**, and **no extensions** — just to get you a clean start and workflow baseline. Let me know!\n\nOr if you'd rather try fixing the current one, send the full traceback and I’ll diagnose it in seconds.","role":"assistant"}]}

[Img2Dataset + CLIP + Chroma](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) — DIY RAG for images**\n\n*   Extracts **CLIP embeddings** from your images\n*   Stores them in **Chroma or FAISS**\n*   Lets you **query images with text** (e.g. “show me glitchcore rainbows with sadness”)\n*   You can extend it to **auto-generate tags or captions** using BLIP, LLaVA, or GPT4-V\n\n> This is a _sleeper banger_ combo if you're comfy with scripts and want full power.\n\n* * *\n\n#### **2\\. [LLaVA (or LLaVA-Next)](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) — Vision-Language model**\n\n*   You feed it an image + text prompt, it outputs rich **descriptions**, **reasoning**, **titles**, **alt-text**, etc.\n*   You can batch it through folders of your art\n*   Pair this with tagging logic and you've got auto-metadata generation\n\n* * *\n\n#### **3\\. \\[AnythingLLM + Custom Plugin for Image Embeds\\]**\n\n*   Normally text-based, but if you write a quick plugin or use a wrapper:\n    *   Add **CLIP or BLIP captioning** to each image\n    *   Store caption + tags + embedding alongside original file\n*   Now you can **ask questions about your art** in natural language\n\n* * *\n\n#### **4\\. \\[ComfyUI + BLIP/LLaVA/CLIP nodes\\]**\n\nSince you’re already running ComfyUI:\n\n*   Use [LLaVA nodes](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_LLaVA_nodes) or [BLIP captioning nodes](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-Manager/blob/main/ComfyUI_BLIP-Model.md)\n*   Build a workflow like:\n    *   Load image → caption → tag → save JSON → optional embedding\n\nThis lets you visually drag-and-drop an art-to-tag pipeline, totally local.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 What I Can Help You Build\n\nIf you want a **clickable UI** for managing your visual RAG archive, I could help you build:\n\n*   A **local HTML/JS or Streamlit UI**\n*   That shows your art\n*   Lists auto-generated tags + descriptions\n*   Lets you query it by vibe/keyword/date\n\nOr — go full mad scientist mode and make a **multimodal whispernet node** that pulls in art, past messages, timelines, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚙️ Suggestion:\n\nStart with:\n\n*   `img2dataset` to get CLIP vectors from your image archive\n*   Pair with `Chroma` to do natural-language searches\n*   Use `BLIP` or `LLaVA` to get auto-captions + tags\n*   Build an index file (`.jsonl`, `.csv`, or sqlite) with:\n    *   `filename`, `caption`, `tags`, `clip_embedding`, `date`, `vibe`, `themes`, etc.\n\nI can generate that entire pipeline for you, and even make the ComfyUI or script version.\n\nWant that?
