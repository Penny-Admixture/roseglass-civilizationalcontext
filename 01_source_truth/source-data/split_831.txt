So the reason I was confused by that is because like by right-clicking and creating an object of that type in the UI and then it creates this code behind it and pre-populated it with that you know that declaration in return so I assumed that that's the type it had to be and like since the function we're adding is not that same type as far as I can tell it's not being declared as a whatever it's being declared as a tarot deck versus a module then how is it magically just a module if we delete that our declaration that's why I expected it to be indented because I expected that the module declaration was for the whole file or something I don't understand what these objects actually are so it's not clear to me from a use standpoint yet but I figured one was like declaring the class and this other thing was like a type or whatever like that kind of hierarchy thus I expected the whole function we added to be indented one level and then we could add other functions and they would all be part of that one module so you're saying delete the module declaration in the outer return and what you gave me is fine just by itself can you help me understand where my misunderstanding arose","role":"user"},{"content":"Ahhh, yep, I see exactly where your mental model got tangled here — and it’s super common for people coming into Roblox/Lua from more class-oriented languages.\n\nThe short version:  \n**There’s no “class” or “type” declaration for a module in Lua.**  \nA “module” in Roblox is _literally just a file that returns a value_.  \nThat value can be _anything_ — a table, a function, a string, whatever — and whatever you return is what other scripts get when they `require()` it.\n\n* * *\n\nWhy you thought you needed `local module = {}`\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you right-click in Roblox Studio and create a ModuleScript, Roblox gives you this:\n\n```lua\nlocal module = {}\n\nreturn module\n```\n\nThat’s just a **template**, not a requirement.  \nThey’re assuming you’ll probably want to return a table (object-like) with functions inside, so they stub it in for you.\n\nIf you wanted multiple related functions, you’d do:\n\n```lua\nlocal module = {}\n\nfunction module.sayHello()\n\tprint(\"Hello!\")\nend\n\nfunction module.add(a, b)\n\treturn a + b\nend\n\nreturn module\n```\n\nThat’s the _classic_ Roblox module style — return a table full of functions and data.\n\n* * *\n\nWhy your TarotDeck “is” a module even without `local module = {}`\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou’re returning this:\n\n```lua\nreturn TarotDeck\n```\n\n…and that **is** the module.  \nWhen another script does:\n\n```lua\nlocal Tarot = require(path.to.TarotModule)\n```\n\n`Tarot` becomes whatever `TarotDeck` was — in your case, a giant Lua table of strings.  \nThere’s no magic type checking; Lua just hands over whatever you returned.\n\nSo:\n\n*   If you `return TarotDeck`, the module **is** that table.\n*   If you `return module`, the module **is** whatever’s in the `module` variable.\n*   If you `return function(...) ... end`, the module **is** that function.\n\n* * *\n\nWhy you don’t indent\n--------------------\n\nIndentation in Lua has nothing to do with “this belongs to a class/module” the way it might in Java, C#, etc.  \nThere’s no “outer scope object” unless you explicitly wrap everything inside a table and then return that table.  \nYour TarotDeck is just a **top-level local variable** that happens to be the thing you return — so there’s no extra level to indent under.\n\n* * *\n\nYour two options in this case\n-----------------------------\n\n### **Option 1: Keep it simple**\n\nIf you only need the table, just:\n\n```lua\nlocal TarotDeck = { ... }\n\nreturn TarotDeck\n```\n\nWhen you `require()` this, you get the table directly.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Option 2: Add it to a “module” table for more stuff later**\n\nIf you might add functions like `drawRandomCard()` or `searchCards()` later, do:\n\n```lua\nlocal module = {}\n\nmodule.TarotDeck = { ... }\n\nfunction module.getCardMeaning(cardName)\n\treturn module.TarotDeck[cardName]\nend\n\nreturn module\n```\n\nThis way, you can expand it without changing how other scripts `require()` it.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can **refactor your TarotDeck into Option 2 style** so you can have both the raw table _and_ helper functions in one place — then you get the “everything’s inside one module” feel you were expecting.\n\nWant me to do that?
