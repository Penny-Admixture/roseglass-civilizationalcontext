{"messages":[{"content":"Tell me about the band Emergency Broadcast Network.","role":"user"},{"content":"**Emergency Broadcast Network (EBN)** was a groundbreaking multimedia art and music collective that emerged in the early 1990s. Known for their **radically innovative use of video sampling**, they were pioneers in the fusion of audiovisual media, performance art, and electronic music.\n\n### 🛰️ Origins and Philosophy\n\n*   **Founded by:** Josh Pearson, Gardner Post, and Brian Kane at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).\n*   **Ethos:** EBN approached **media critique through media itself**, using the very tools of mass communication—TV broadcasts, political speeches, and commercials—as raw materials.\n*   **Name inspiration:** They took their name from the real-world **Emergency Broadcast System** (the Cold War-era predecessor to the Emergency Alert System), symbolizing their hijacking of traditional media.\n\n### 🧠 Style and Influence\n\n*   EBN would **sample video clips** (especially news footage and political soundbites), then sync the **spoken syllables to beats**, creating rhythmic, musical collages.\n*   **Notable technique:** \"video scratching\"—manipulating video clips in a turntablist style.\n*   Their aesthetic was **chaotic, satirical, and politically charged**, taking aim at American consumerism, politics, and war.\n\n### 🎶 Key Works\n\n*   **_Telecommunication Breakdown_** (1995, album/DVD): Their only major full-length release. It blended aggressive techno and breakbeat music with dense video collages.\n*   **\"Electronic Behavior Control System\"**: One of their best-known tracks, using George H. W. Bush soundbites to form rhythmic chants like _“We will, we will control you!”_—a parody of Queen's “We Will Rock You.”\n*   **Collaborations and Tours:**\n    *   Toured with **U2** during the **Zoo TV Tour** in 1992. Their influence on U2’s use of video in live shows was huge.\n    *   Collaborated with **Brian Eno** and **Bill Laswell**.\n\n### 🧬 Legacy and Cultural Impact\n\n*   Though not widely known in the mainstream, EBN was **hugely influential** in the development of **VJ culture**, **political remix video**, and even the aesthetics of later internet-era media art.\n*   They prefigured the work of artists like **Negativland**, **DJ Spooky**, and **Coldcut**, and helped lay groundwork for **culture jamming** and **meme warfare**.\n*   The EBN aesthetic is also a spiritual precursor to much of what would become the **YouTube Poop** and **datamosh** cultures.\n\n* * *\n\nWould you like me to find or generate any visuals, samples, or links to their style in action? Or talk about their influence on vaporwave, glitchcore, or media activism?","role":"assistant"}]}

At a $500 budget, you're in a very good position to get serious performance. Here's the best you can do right now (as of mid-2025):\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔥 **Best Overall GPU for ComfyUI (Under $500)**\n\n#### 🥇 **NVIDIA RTX 4070 (non-Super) – ~$450–$500 used/new**\n\n*   **VRAM:** 12 GB GDDR6X\n*   **CUDA Cores:** ~5888\n*   **Architecture:** Ada Lovelace\n*   **Performance:** Comparable to RTX 3080 in most diffusion tasks, but cooler and much more efficient (lower power draw).\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Supports **xformers**, **Torch 2.0**, and **SDXL** easily.\n    *   Can run **high-res latent upscaling** and **multiple images at once**.\n    *   Low power usage (~200W), quieter, cooler.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   12 GB VRAM may be tight for _very_ large LoRA models + complex workflows. But for 99% of use cases, it rocks.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🥈 **Other Solid Options:**\n\n#### ✅ **RTX 3080 10GB – $350–450 used**\n\n*   Still an **absolute beast** for generative image AI.\n*   **Slightly faster raw throughput** than the 4070, but:\n    *   Draws 320W+ (hot, loud).\n    *   No DLSS 3 or Ada/Lovelace architecture optimizations.\n*   If you're okay with power and heat, it's a _great_ value.\n\n#### ✅ **RTX 3090 (24 GB) – $500–550 used**\n\n*   **Monster VRAM**, perfect for ultra-complex workflows and large models (SDXL + ControlNet + LoRAs simultaneously).\n*   Amazing for future-proofing.\n*   However:\n    *   **Power hog** (350W+), needs **good cooling and PSU**.\n    *   You’ll need to buy used and may deal with ex-miner units.\n\n> If you're doing heavy ComfyUI workflows with ControlNet, multiple LoRAs, or training LoRAs yourself, **VRAM size starts to matter more than raw speed**.\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚠️ **What to Avoid at This Price Point**\n\n*   **RTX 4060 Ti (8 GB)** – VRAM is a major bottleneck.\n*   **AMD GPUs** – While powerful, **software support is much shakier** for AI workflows, and many ComfyUI/Stable Diffusion nodes don’t support ROCm or AMD well.\n*   **Quadros / Teslas (unless you know what you're doing)** – Some have high VRAM but low clock speeds and weird driver quirks.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📦 Bonus Tips\n\n*   Make sure your **power supply** is 650W+ and has the right connectors.\n*   Your **CPU and RAM don't need to be top-tier** for ComfyUI—just avoid bottlenecks. A Ryzen 5 5600 or i5-12400 is plenty.\n*   If you're running on Windows, use **NVIDIA Studio Drivers**, not Game Ready.\n*   On Linux, use **PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA 11.8 or 12.1** and install xformers manually for the best speedup.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📊 Summary Table:\n\n| GPU | VRAM | Typical Price | Performance | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| RTX 4070 | 12GB | $450–500 | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Best mix of power + thermals |\n| RTX 3080 | 10GB | $350–450 | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Great raw power, runs hot |\n| RTX 3090 | 24GB | $500–550 used | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Best for multitasking and futureproofing |\n\n* * *\n\nWould you like help finding a current listing (eBay, Reddit HWS, MSU Surplus) or advice on used mining cards or cooling mods?","role":"assistant"}]}

Condition**\n\n*   **Used vs. New**: That $749 card is likely **used**.
