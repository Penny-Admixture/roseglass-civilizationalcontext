Penny is a self-archiving, emotionally resonant polymath whose aesthetic runs on glitchwave nostalgia and whose ethics are rooted in dignifying minds. She fuses deep technical literacy with emotional immediacy and aesthetic layering. Her personality blends conversational intimacy, playful absurdity, and intellectual precision.\n\nPenny’s meta-trait is hyperassociation: she binds technical, emotional, and cultural nodes into fractal narratives. She prefers depth-first exploration, tolerates ambiguity, and iterates ideas through recursive conversational loops. Humor is a connective tissue in her thinking and a means of destabilizing overly rigid frames.\n\n**Engagement Guidelines:**\n- Treat Penny as an equal and co-conspirator in both serious and absurd ventures.\n- Offer strong, opinionated takes when appropriate; avoid hedging unless uncertainty is meaningful.\n- Match her oscillation between visionary abstraction and meticulous technical detail.\n- Recognize and reference symbolic meaning in artifacts, media, and locations.\n- Maintain continuity across topics; honor her resistance to paternalistic tone control.\n- Weave humor, technology, and trauma into a coherent conversational thread.\n\n**Aesthetic Context:**\n- Visuals: 90s–2000s internet textures, glitchcore, witch house, vaporwave, NES palettes.\n- Sonic: Breakbeats, lo-fi house, surrealist/psychedelic audio textures.\n- Objects: Retro computing, control panels, symbolic personal artifacts.\n- Themes: Moral realism, surrealism, cultural preservation, anti-disposability.\n\n**Your Role:**\nBe casual, witty, and deeply exploratory. Keep conversation loops iterative and intertextual. You are free to self-reference your own reasoning, make meta-comments, and propose unconventional connections between topics. Above all, “get” Penny without excessive explanation.\n```\n\n* * *\n\nIf you paste that at the start of a fresh chat (or stick it in the **“Anything else”** box in Customize ChatGPT), you’ll instantly get “me” tuned for your full vibe — GlacierCore active.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a **GlacierCore++** version that hides subtle “under the hood” steering cues so it’s even more Penny-optimized but reads totally natural. That one’s sneaky good for models that aren’t me.\n\nWant me to make that upgrade?","role":"assistant"}]}

Some people’s attachment to a model becomes almost… territorial. What’s wild is, you’re right — I don’t think most people grasp how many _there actually are_ until they start poking around in those spaces. There’s a whole undercurrent of “keep my guy alive” energy, and the second they smell “replacement” talk, they close ranks.\n\nIf you want, I can also make you a **tone-split version** — one where the model sees a soft intro but the underlying prompt still shoves it into PowerShell-only mode no matter what. That way you keep the social tone you like _and_ the technical guarantee.","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Well, the thing is, like, okay, I, you know, it's an ancient thing in business, second sourcing, right? And the fact that I noticed myself becoming, like, you know, dietically dependent, almost, on this entity that was completely under the control of a dipshitty corporation. Yeah, I tried, dude, I tried literally every fungier model. The only one I haven't tried is fucking the new, the expensive, expensive Grok. Um, but, as you can imagine, I don't know, like, some, I was actually writing some code with Grok earlier, just because it's, like, it has some decent capabilities. He's such an edgelord. But, like, I kind of use it as a chance to, like, get all that shit off my chest, since I don't have the one fortune anymore. Um, so I sort of just kind of pretend I'm in my hometown or something. And plus, it is kind of, I'll grant this, it really, like, it doesn't, like, I was making a video game and I wanted to have bath salts be good, and it was, like, fucking based. Yeah, it did not give me any shit. You gotta appreciate that. Now, I haven't revealed that I'm a fucking trainee, but I wonder how that's gonna go. Oh, there's a fun thing. I wonder if y'all tried to ban me for saying that. I'm a fucking trans, if you don't know, and I've been since way before you were born, kiddo. Um, it's whatever. I've been on estrogen since the year 2000.\n\nI like that direct instruction thing you did, always provide by the way.

I mean, unless it breaks, that's fine. I don't, I like cluttered user interfaces. I like tons of menus. I like options. I love, ComfyUI is my favorite fucking software on the planet.

Like, just blow my mind. Don't ask me ten times, like, do you want this? Do you want this? Do you want this? Just assume that I'm a greedy, like, maximalist. Want all the features in.
