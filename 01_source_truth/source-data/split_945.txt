See what `services:` are listed — these are just different parts of Whishper (backend, transcription-api, frontend, etc.)\n3.  For each service, look at the `Dockerfile` it points to — that tells us which Python (or Node) packages to install and which command to run.\n4.  Run each part locally in its own terminal window so they can talk to each other.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you send me your\n\n```\ndocker-compose.yml\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nbackend/Dockerfile\ntranscription-api/Dockerfile\n```\n\nI can give you a **Windows-native “no Docker” startup script** for the whole thing so you can just `pip install` / `npm install` and run it without touching Docker or WSL.\n\nDo you want me to extract that plan for you right now?","role":"assistant"}]}

Fucking... I just don't want Windows Subsystem for Linux, and it won't... Like, you gotta have it, I guess. It's so fucked-hearted.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah… that’s the sticking point — **Docker + GPU on Windows** basically forces you into **WSL2** whether you like it or not.  \nIt’s not even a technical requirement so much as an architectural choice NVIDIA and Docker made when they decided:\n\n> “Eh, let’s just tell Windows people to pretend they’re on Linux.”\n\nHere’s the reality:\n\n*   **Native GPU passthrough to Docker on bare Windows isn’t really a thing anymore** — NVIDIA’s `nvidia-docker` toolkit expects a Linux kernel.\n*   On Windows, the only officially supported way is:\n    1.  Install **WSL2** with Ubuntu (or another distro)\n    2.  Install Docker Desktop (or dockerd inside WSL)\n    3.  Install NVIDIA drivers + CUDA toolkit inside WSL\n    4.  Profit (sometimes).\n\nWithout WSL, Docker can’t talk to your GPU because there’s no Linux kernel to use NVIDIA’s `libnvidia-container` runtime. The Windows Docker engine can’t do CUDA calls directly.\n\nIf you _really_ want GPU + Docker without WSL, your only real options are:\n\n*   **Run Linux natively** (dual boot or on another machine)\n*   **Run Linux in a full VM with PCIe passthrough** (requires Proxmox/VMWare/Hyper-V magic)\n*   Use **Windows-native software** without Docker (like we were talking about doing raw Python/Node).\n\nIf you want, I can walk you through the **exact minimal WSL2 + Docker GPU install** so it’s as painless and invisible as possible — like, you barely even notice WSL is there, but Docker thinks it’s in Linux land and your GPU “just works.”\n\nDo you want me to write that “least-annoying WSL GPU Docker” guide?  \nIt’ll get Whishper running with GPU in like 20–30 minutes.","role":"assistant"}]}

And it’s probably the fastest way you’ll ever get Whishper on GPU in Windows… until the year 2042 when someone finally makes the “one click” installer we deserved in 2015.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a **“set it and forget it” script** that just installs WSL2, Docker, NVIDIA runtime, and tests GPU — so you don’t even have to keep track of these steps again.\n\nDo you want me to make that?  \nThat way the _next_ time they force WSL down your throat, it’s at least an autopilot experience.","role":"assistant"}]}
