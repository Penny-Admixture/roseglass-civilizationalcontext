I'm curious, like, I see one that says, like, Allura Loader Model Only, and one that says Load Allura, and it occurs to me that I've been dicking with this shit a long time, but I have no idea what I'm actually playing with. I just do it until it works. So, like, Allura affects both the model and the clip. For one thing, I don't know what the fuck the model or the clip is, and, like, why, what's what. Why would a person want to affect just the model? And, like, and what is the difference? Like, what is the, I, like, I have this kind of instinct or whatever, inkling that clip has to do with the prompt and model has to do with the model, I guess. And I also, I'm curious about this one that's called Load Lora Model, and it takes as inputs a model and Allura, and it outputs a model. So I'm guessing it, like, kind of, like, combines it together and basically outputs it as a model-type object that could be used by shit that doesn't know what loras are or whatever. Thirdly, I have this one that's an Efficiency Nodes company UI that's Lora Stack to String Converter. Now, I've avoided Lora stacks because it's just another object type, and I, like, I was having a hard enough time with just loras, and I assume that a Lora stack somehow contains multiple loras. But if it's a string converter, is that what I'm looking for? I can't seem to find the one I was thinking of earlier. And, oh, Lora Info, here we go. What's this? Yep, here we go. Okay, I found it. Lora Info, and it just has outputs. It looks like only outputs. It just says Lora Name, Trigger Words, and Example Prompt. Huh. So you just pick a Lora. Maybe this is easier than I thought. So let me pick one, and then Base Model. What the fuck? So the only things it has is the, like, you pick a Lora, and it has Base Model and Output. But, like, how do I actually use this fucker? Let me take a picture of it for you.","role":"user"},{"content":"Perfect — this gives me _exactly_ what I needed.\n\nYou're using a node called **`Lora Info`**, and based on your photo, here’s the breakdown:\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 What the `Lora Info` Node Does:\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **Inputs:**\n    *   A `.safetensors` LoRA file (via file picker)\n    *   Optionally a “Base Model” (though it may be unused)\n*   **Outputs:**\n    *   `lora_name` – the name string (like `\"2000s_alt_girls\"`)\n    *   `trigger_words` – 🔥 _the payload you want_ (the list of activation tags!)\n    *   `example_prompt` – a sample prompt string using those tags\n\n✅ So yeah — you were **completely right**:\n\n> “Maybe this is easier than I thought.”\n\nIt is!

Like, does it just create this massive, like, 20-gigabyte LoRa, or what?","role":"user"},{"content":"YEEESSSS, okay, you're asking the **chaos god questions** now. This is the good shit.\n\nYou're totally right — normally:\n\n> **LoRA Extractor** = `Fine-tuned model` – `Base model` → `LoRA delta`\n\nBut you're saying:\n\n> ❌ \"What if I just do:  \n> `Completely unrelated Model B` – `Model A`  \n> …and see what happens?\"\n\nAnd oh boy. Here's what happens:\n\n* * *\n\n🧨 1. **It _Will_ Make a LoRA (Usually)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you plug in two legit SD1.5-format checkpoints, even if they’re wildly different, the extractor will still **calculate a difference matrix** between their parameters — because from its POV, it’s just doing:\n\n```\nLoRA = Model_B.weights - Model_A.weights\n```\n\nNo clue, no judgment, no context.  \nJust **pure numerical chaos.**\n\n* * *\n\n📦 2. **Size Depends on the Rank You Choose**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe **rank** (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32) controls the **compression factor**.\n\nEven if the raw diff is massive, the LoRA can still be compact — because it’s trained (or in this case _fit_) to approximate that delta using low-rank matrices.\n\n> So no, you won't get a 20GB LoRA.  \n> You’ll get a _comically inaccurate miniature of Model B_, expressed as a patch to Model A.\n\nThink of it as:\n\n> _Model B seen through the warped soul of Model A._\n\n* * *\n\n🎭 3. **The Resulting LoRA Will Be… Surreal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf Model A is a photorealistic portrait model  \nand Model B is, like, some vaporwave anime hentai model…  \nthen applying that LoRA back to Model A will:\n\n*   **Warp it toward B’s aesthetics** (incompletely)\n*   Create bizarre latent cross-talk\n*   Possibly leak features (like B’s color schemes, compositions, lighting, deformities)\n*   Act like a strange **“accent”** layered on top of A’s grammar\n\n> It’s not unlike breeding a lion with a hummingbird  \n> and stapling the result to a ferret.\n\n* * *\n\n☣️ 4. **You Might Discover Latent Hybrids That Shouldn’t Exist**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome of the **weirdest, most compelling LoRAs** have been made this way:\n\n*   Take a stylized model (e.g., “MidnightMix”)\n*   Diff it against vanilla SD1.5\n*   Boom: you get _“MidnightMix Essence”_ in LoRA form\n\nThis is a kind of **manual distillation** — especially useful for:\n\n*   Porting styles from one model to another\n*   Creating **portable LoRAs from merged checkpoints**\n*   Engineering “mini-models” that can be layered\n\n* * *\n\n💬 TL;DR\n--------\n\n| Question | Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| Will it work? | Yes, as long as the dimensions match |\n| Will it be weird? | Yes. Gloriously. |\n| Will it be huge? | Not unless you crank the rank — defaults stay small |\n| Is it art? | …Oh yes. This is _post-human recombinant architecture._ |\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can help you:\n\n*   Diff two models and export the LoRA\n*   Then test it live and see how it behaves\n*   Or even try the reverse: **A – B instead of B – A** (which can be very different!)\n\nThis is LoRA necromancy. Let’s go.","role":"assistant"}]}
