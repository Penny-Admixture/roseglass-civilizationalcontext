Copernicus, I guess, mixed with the Peter principle. But, like, so I put the screenshots in reverse order by accident, but, like, so that is the one, the fucking sequence I was just discussing with you, ran on a screenshot of anything on. And, like, you'll see the first iteration is kind of interesting. It shifts things towards, like, yellow and red. It's very blown differently from how it started. Okay, so far so good. Promising. I'll keep that image for sure. I mean, I keep them all, but, like, that's one I would use for fodder for other ones. Oh, because I know—oh, shit. I forgot to tell you. So there's sequences of sequences. So, like, you know, like, in this case, we ran that sequence on it, and basically, by iteration two, it's—you know, that's anyway. So the category this one would go into is, like, quickly converges on one color and washes out, and then the color is whatever that is, yellow or green or something, right? And so that's one—so basically, within two iterations, it's useless. And if you go again, it'll just be pure yellow to the point where if MSP, if you use the fill tool, it'll just fill the whole thing. It's, like, all pushed to the same value. And so, yeah, that's one of the more general characteristics is—oh, yeah, we need another column, sorry—that will count how, like, basically, there's a number that's an integer, and it's—okay, most of these sequences, if you run it enough times, will end up with something that is all one color. And the way I test that is load it in MSPaint, use the fill tool. If it fills it perfectly, then it's done, right? And so the integer here is the number of iterations it takes of this sequence for that to happen, okay? And for some sequences, as far as I can tell, they're either infinite or really, really long. So it can't be required. And so for some of these, it'll cost a lot of, like, computation to, like, calculate it, because, like, as far as I can tell, it just goes on and on and on. Hey, that's an interesting question. I wonder if that's ever been posed. So for the system I just described, with the criteria I just described, and you're characterizing these sequences, A, are there ones that are, like, the equivalent of irrational numbers that will just go forever? B, what's the computational complexity of calculating that? And, like, you know, I don't know. Is there anything interesting here? But for really, for real, okay, so this one, for this case, now I'm going to talk about sequences of sequences. So for this case, we executed this sequence, and basically the number, I don't know, let's call that number, like, rho or gamma or some shit. I don't know. Think of something badass that's actually apropos from a sciency standpoint, but, like, that extinguishment number, like, until it, like, reaches full stasis of one color or something. So for this one, that number is probably three or four. Sometimes it'll surprise you. Sometimes it'll surprise you. Like, it'll look like it's going to wash out, and then it pulls out of the dirt, and it can go on forever. It's really surprising. Like a paper, but brushes the ground and takes off. So I wouldn't say for sure, but it looks like this one's number is going to turn out to be three. It's extinguishment number or whatever. I don't know if that's really the best term, but. And so in this case, we'll have three outputs, right? Well, those are all fodder for running any of our sequences in our sequence table again on. And in fact, that's, like, some of the best source of material is, like, sometimes there's sequences that sort of, like, you know, the ones that, like, wash out to nothing. Well, sometimes you count, you can run a different sequence that is just as, like, crazy, but it goes kind of in a different direction. They're all, like, stepping through color space. And so if you judiciously, like, pick, I mean, these are very metaphorical terms, like, leftward and rightward or, like, fore and aft, you can steer the ship without crashing into the walls color-wise. And so by judiciously applying these sequences and, like, sequences that are, like, counter sequences in that sense that stop it from, like, going into the non-dynamic behavior to where it becomes static, you can keep it from, you basically, like, keep it between the lines and you can just keep exploring. So I guess eventually there will be some way we could try to calculate, uh, sort of, like, so, like, for instance, two different types of sequences that both, like, drive towards, like, you know, mostly red hues, right? And they quickly freaking, you know, become static and pure red. Then they would have basically, I'm thinking almost like an angle of intersection. So, like, if you had two sequences that drive ship towards red, then they're going to, you know, if you interleave them or stack them, they're going to drive towards red that much faster. Whereas if you have one that is removing the amount of red in a picture, then if you apply that sequence with the red one or stack it, it's going to, you know, it'll stop you from reaching the static parts of the configuration space so fast. And I imagine there's ones that are orthogonal to each other, right? So, like, say one sequence was just taking the brightness up and down, right? And another sequence was just taking the fucking saturation up and down. Well, I don't think they'd affect each other, right? So in that case, their angle of intersection would be, I guess, 90 degrees or something. And I'm not sure how you define that geometry. But, like, so I'd like to include that somehow. And then since we have sequences and then sequences of sequences, but the thing is, they're not just two things. Oh, shit. So, well, I guess every two pairwise, they would have an angle to find between, right? But the sequences of sequences would be something different, right? So, like, the angle of intersection, huh. I don't know how we do that. You help me, I guess, on that. Like, how do we incorporate the geometry? It's not even really geometry. It's geometry in my head. But then the sequences of sequences thing is different. So, like, I'm just kind of motivating you why, like, navigating in that geometry is why I want this. But basically, yeah. So, like, I would also want to be able to store sequences of sequences. But don't worry. There is not anything further than that. I don't need to store sequences of sequences of sequences for any reason. It ends there, I think. Yes, I believe so. Because we can compose those.

As of right now, we still need to run the alter table on FSViewer, transform sequences, the add column, basically everything other than the create table FSViewer sequence similarity from this thing I'm about to include. And then, basically, can you make me something that catches me up?\n\n-- Add extinguishment_number to existing transform_sequences table\nALTER TABLE fsviewer_transform_sequences\nADD COLUMN extinguishment_number INTEGER;\n\n-- New table: Sequence-of-sequences (meta-sequences)\nCREATE TABLE fsviewer_sequence_of_sequences (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  name TEXT,\n  notes TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Bridge table: Ordered links between sequences (meta-sequence steps)\nCREATE TABLE fsviewer_sequence_of_sequence_steps (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  sos_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES fsviewer_sequence_of_sequences(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  sequence_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES fsviewer_transform_sequences(id),\n  step_index INTEGER NOT NULL,\n  notes TEXT\n);\n\n-- Optional: Table to capture similarity between sequences (e.g. “angle of intersection”)\nCREATE TABLE fsviewer_sequence_similarity (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  sequence_id_a INTEGER REFERENCES fsviewer_transform_sequences(id),\n  sequence_id_b INTEGER REFERENCES fsviewer_transform_sequences(id),\n  angle_of_intersection DOUBLE PRECISION,\n  similarity_notes TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);","role":"user"},{"content":"Crystal clear.
