{"messages":[{"content":"what kind of system would do face recognition and allow me to assign names to faces on photos like these?  i tried immich and one other one and tr","role":"user"},{"content":"You're on the right track looking for self-hosted or open systems that let you do face recognition + tagging across large photo libraries. Immich is one of the best, but it does have some quirks. Here's a breakdown of what’s available and what might suit your needs better if Immich didn’t quite get you there:\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔍 **1\\. Immich (self-hosted)**\n\n**Face Recognition:** ✅  \n**Name Assignment to Faces:** ✅ (via face clusters)  \n**Why it might’ve failed you:**\n\n*   Face clustering UI is still in development (as of mid-2025, some features still experimental)\n*   Difficult to manually confirm/edit face IDs en masse\n*   Can choke on very large libraries or non-standard EXIF  \n    **Fixes:**\n*   Check if you’re using the latest `immich-server` version and enable advanced features in the `.env` file\n*   Consider pairing it with something like **FaceFusion** or **DeepFaceLab** to pre-process faces\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 **2\\. DeepFace / FaceNet (custom scripts)**\n\nIf you’re comfortable running Python scripts:\n\n*   Use `deepface` (GitHub: [serengil/deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)) or `facenet-pytorch`\n*   Can scan images, embed faces, cluster them, and let you assign names\n*   You can then build a lightweight interface (e.g., Flask) to tag and view\n\n**Pros:** Total control, scriptable  \n**Cons:** Not plug-and-play\n\n* * *\n\n### 🖼️ **3\\. digiKam (desktop app, open-source)**\n\n**Face Recognition:** ✅  \n**Manual + Automatic Tagging:** ✅  \n**Notes:**\n\n*   Best for desktop batch tagging, especially if you want to review face clusters manually\n*   Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)\n*   Can write metadata back to image files (EXIF/XMP)\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧩 **4\\. Photoprism (self-hosted)**\n\n**Face Recognition:** Partial/Experimental\n\n*   Offers face clustering, but UI is minimal\n*   Better at object detection than named faces\n*   Not as polished as Immich in face tagging\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 **5\\. ComfyUI Custom Workflow** _(if you want to go wild)_\n\nSince you're already deep in ComfyUI:\n\n*   You can rig a face detector node (e.g. with InsightFace, or YOLOv8 → DeepFace)\n*   Route cropped faces to a face clustering node\n*   Write a metadata tag output per image using Python nodes or Post-processing\n\n**This route gives total control but takes work to build.** You could build an image annotator GUI right into your local workflow!\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔧 Honorable Mentions:\n\n*   **PimEyes (cloud, not self-hosted)** – High accuracy, but privacy red flags\n*   **AWS Rekognition / Google Vision API** – Great results, but $$$ and cloud-only\n*   **Node-based pipeline w/ OpenCV + Faiss** – Super powerful but DIY\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔮 My Recommendation (Based on You):\n\nGiven your tech level, I'd recommend:\n\n> 🔁 **Use Immich for ingestion + DeepFace for clustering + a custom tagging UI**  \n> or  \n> 💻 **Use digiKam locally for tight control over face naming, then optionally sync metadata to Immich**\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can generate a basic UI or pipeline starter for assigning names to face clusters using DeepFace + a local image viewer. Want that?","role":"assistant"}]}
