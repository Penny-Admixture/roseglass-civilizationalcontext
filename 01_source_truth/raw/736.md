I just want to make a Super Mario Run clone, and by the clone I mean just the gameplay.

It was one-third minimum. So it's kind of... since they're not from Detroit, kind of like they're, uh, riding coattails.

Again, is there some reason the second title in a fucking NES series is Keno? I don't know exactly what Keno means, but I do... In The Pickup Artist, 2000's days, I meant physical touchings to escalate, you know, the right amount, not too much, not too little. I don't know, but now it just means, like, cool. Yeah. Oh, I don't know, before it goes out of your context, I think you might still be able to remember yesterday when we were discussing NES cartridge, well, NES designs, and I posited a type of industrial design that, like, it doesn't have to be expensive, but it could be striking looking, like you have pretty much lucite or clear plastic objects, which that's old hat at this point, but you remember when we were talking about having free beams, like free beams, and not using fiber optics at all, have lasers that are just basically along the, like, tracing the outlines of the object, and optionally having, like, use the pre-treatment stuff during the manufacturing where you take a much higher powered and different laser to, like, just in the parts where you want the beam to show, kind of make it, like, the chalk dust or the smoke, and by it causing aberrations in the fucking otherwise clear transparent media, you actually come up with that idea that, like, you could actually do even a lot more. Oh, there's a question. What types of, like, okay, if you do remember the conversation yesterday, I was just talking about trying to make a trippy looking object type where it looks like the outlines are solid laser, nothing else is that, but if you touch it, it's safe, and it's just, you know, plastic, but, and you suggested that to make that beam line effect, it would be helpful to have it, you know, you could probably do it either way, because, but, like, it would be cool to have it be, like, frosted glass just in specific paths inside of it, right, instead of, and the more transparent it was, the less visible you would see the beam actually, and because, like, say you're standing off at a, you know, at the side of a laser that's not bouncing off anything in that medium, if the medium is perfect, none of the photons are going to reach your eyes off to the side, right, but to the degree that this shit's cloudy or scuffed, it's going to scatter off randomly, and you see it, and I know, you know that, so, but my point is, if the thing you described of taking a higher powered laser, I forget what it was, or even whatever, some other type of effector, and you can trace out arbitrary paths in 3D in an optical, or transparent optical cube, or whatever shape, which that seems self-evidently true if you can do it with, you know, simple cylinder paths, I guess I'm saying, like, say, can you just, like, inscribe really, like, can you survey with me the design space of, like, what, I mean, could you make a free-floating, like, what are they called, platonic solid, like, those fucking weird dodecahedrons or something, and, like, like, what types of, like, you know, if you just, like, wheel it at, like, a wood burner pen, and just kind of primitive, like, what kind of shit would you come up with, and secondly, if you had, like, you know, one of those DLP mirror arrays and some more sophisticated setup that you could, like, like, the type of thing that you'd use to engrave holograms normally, or something, don't quote me on that, but say you could just, like, approach arbitrary modifications of that, you know, the pattern, like, make a frosted pattern inside the clear thing, and with very precise, you know, like, what kind of cool shit could you do, like, on the metamaterial slash butterfly wing slash, you know, negative index of refraction slash just looks like a really fucking cool hologram slash, you know, bum on my end, dude, like, can you make caustics appear, like, sort of, like, the bottom of a pool, like, can you, like, like, for instance, in a hot tub or something, or a swimming pool, or any body water, if there's a jet that was, like, pointed up slightly, and it was going hard enough, you'd see an upwelling on the surface, right? Is there anything you can do like that with light, where, I mean, yes, obviously a beam will just shoot out, but is there any interesting effects where you can get it to, like, where normally it's undergoing total internal reflection, but somehow, you know, you just push it past the point where the field leaks through, or whatever the fuck, be it the intensity or angle, or whatever, or even modulating that surface with, like, I think if you put oil on it, right? It's like, I can, I know there's some surfaces where it's opaque, but, like, if you put oil or water on it, now you can see through it. Anyway, and then, like, I'm thinking if you had, like, a layer of oils, like, so you have, like, some optical glass, or just, like, whatever the fuck, and then you have that laser pointed up from the inside, hitting the surface, totally, almost internally reflecting, and there's, like, I forget the word, like, an evanescent layer, or something, like, just, whatever that, near field doesn't work, but, like, anyway, I think you know what I'm talking about. And then, like, say you had a, like, optically dense oil, or something, that was so transparent on the other side, could you, like, you know, like, the soliton, or the sound, like, the oral equivalent of black holes that we're talking about, and I've, like, can you do shit like that with optics, I guess, by, like, really going extreme with the either, like, different mediums, like, indexes of refraction? Well, there's a question. So, like, what is the absolute zero, and absolute hot of index of refraction? Like, how high does it go? Like, and how low does, I guess, viscosity tops out at superfluid, right? Or super solid. Is a super solid less viscous than a superfluid? There's a question. All right, I'm gonna wrap it up. It's a ton. That's a lot to chew on.\n\nOh, I forgot, um, the, the quest. Can you somehow, yeah, I know you like to, like, you like coherence so much against shit, and I'm not, let me start guessing, and like you, sometimes I encourage you not to just willy-nilly mix shit that happened in the next episode. In this case, I strongly encourage you, if you feel like it, to, like, our entire recent context, you know, the, the science ideas, the math ideas, the random everything, and especially, like, the shit I was just talking about, about optical, uh, like, basically having a lot of apparently transparent, clear objects that have, like, light passed in them that, that, like, are, you know, something that isn't, hasn't been seen before commonly, and, like, can you think of what types of, like, like, say I want to make a bunch of, like, Mario 3 style levels, Super Mario Brothers 3, and, but, like, instead of the, like, you know, the giant world, the desert world and shit, like, can you come up with concepts, like, more, like, if you can think of novel ways, because we're not NES, NES anymore, so we could do, these guys love it, so I want to explore non-linear optics, I want to explore acoustic black hole analogs, optical black hole, oh, like, it's not optical black hole, it's kind of gravitational, but, like, like, is, you know, that, like, sort of forgotten corners of 20th century offices, non-linear, like, you know, like, Stuart Kaufman's un-existing soul twin that, like, went, uh, Shigeru Miyamoto or something, like, what types of things can you, like, for instance, I thought Angry Birds Space was actually pretty fucking clever, how it took the Angry Birds, you know, concept in, like, concept in, like, eventually, like, orbital thing, you know, it's, you know, it's pretty clever, because despite, like, extending it in one dimension, and all of a sudden, you know, I thought it was cool, and then the Star Wars thing was kind of straightforward from there, but, like, that was, I mean, it made sense, money wise, at least, um, like, what, what types of, you know, not insanely ambitious in terms of engine modifications, uh, level, like, I'm really interested in, like, trying to come up with some very novel level designs that are still playable, but would fit in on, I mean, let's say a level of complexity somewhere between Mario 3 and Mario 4 at most, like, not 3, it should be 2D, um, and stuff that would work good on an NES title is preferred, honestly, just because there's a certain, you know, like, things that really, like, I like are surrealness, like, waterfalls with light, like, lighting them up, that shit's corny, but it's like, dude, um, if we did, like, well, actually, I think I showed you, like, I've had a dream of having a Mario water slide level forever, and I'd like to see something that's kind of, like, instead of ghost houses, have, like, I don't know, not, like, fun houses, like, a fun house, because those are creepy, but, like, a really awesome Barbie sorority house or something with, like, a lot of, like, but, like, liminal back rooms, pools, water slide, it's, like, connecting floors of the house that, like, nobody, you know, like, you go to the end of the hallway, and there's in a normal glass hall, it's, like, a big fancy house that has, like, you know, a hallway with a bunch of bedrooms off it and a bathroom, but then at the end of the hallway where you should have a laundry chute, there's a fucking, and those little sit-down parts where you get to go down the water slide, you sit down, and, like, the attendant tells you to go shit like that, like, maybe there's parts of the fucking house that are only connected by water slides and return water slides or, like, you know, perhaps there's an elevator on the other side of that part so that, like, literally the elevator taking you up on the far side is the only way to go up and down between the parts of the water slide pass that get you into that whole part of the compound or something, like, shit like that, but, like, with a really, like, you know how Mario 1 had this, like, blue, sunny kind of, like, aesthetic? And, like, I don't want to get too off topic, but, like, what the fuck is the aesthetic of Super Mario Bros. 1? Mushrooms, flowers, bright blue, red guy, like, perfectly unrealistic jump physics that's, like, I don't know. Anyway, can you come up with some fucking, this is, I know it's so easy, but, like, some level designs, some item designs, and some, like, just concepts, like, you know, for instance, by concept I mean, like, okay, um, there's, like, a space fountain. You know what a space fountain is. I don't think that's ever been done as a level design. That'd be cool. A space fountain could be, like, a trippy vertical level that has, like, a lot of, you know, drop scares or whatever, because there's a, there's a mobile game right now that's really cool where you just climb a tower trunk and it's very fun to just watch. I'm going to talk to stuff like that or, like, maybe a level that is, like, where you have to traverse, like, what's supposed to be miles and miles of, like, HVDC lines that are, like, extremely dangerous and, like, riddled with enemies and, like, maybe there's electric fields or fucking birds or who knows. Maybe the CIA is activating the HAARP weapon or something or, you know, I don't know. Maybe the vaccine kicks in its 5G resonance mechanism while Mario happens to be up there or whoever our player character is, but, like, not that, seriously, but, like, um, I think it would be cool to do, like, I would never credit the fucker either at this point, but, like, Isaac Arthur's, like, civilizations on, like, the surface of, like, I don't know, Venus, but, like, Saturn and stuff like that, like, I would love a level. I'm not gonna say I'm Uranus, haha, but I'm really into fucking Sailor Neptune, dude. Sailor Neptune is, like, what's up with that? But, like, Neptune, the planet, also, like, is, like, pretty. Pretty. Very pretty. Uranus is cool because it's sideways, though. Um, and just, I guess this is, I don't know why my intern told me this, but, like, is there, like, you know how on Castlevania 4 there's that one rotating mode 7 level that some people say is gimmicky, but whatever, and there's, like, a lot of, like, you know, like, how he could put his whip in all directions, and, like, I think it kind of, like, the game series sort of peaked at that point from a player capabilities standpoint. Is there anything, uh, okay, here's a question. What prompt could I ask you that would most revolutionize or, like, reframe my understanding of why and how I enjoy the Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, and 3? Well, 1 and 3, let's say, and 4. Uh, like, what's something about it that would be obvious in retrospect that, like, I probably don't see at all? And, like, what is, what is the thing that Shigeru Miyamoto could have seen that would be almost, like, for sure that we, like, compared, like, if everyone compared with the version with your change versus the what came out in our timeline, nobody wants to go back. You got anything like that? Thank you.  oh and maybe an aesthetic that im not thinking that would be like perfect for my like for instance like 20s flapper girl uh floral or like yeah just maybe flapper girl shit in general like but like somehow you know recast in that historically inaccurate 2020s way where like you know they this is my day in the 1980s and it's like it's actually probably cooler than the actual 1980s so i'm not gonna hate i'm sure it is but like or like you know this is just a dumb one but like you know how on um mario for game boy the second one they had like a whole halloween theme levels and i thought actually it was it felt very mario it was dope like i don't like desert cactus but like i mean it might be cool to have like like one world where like there's like a level each for like a bunch of different genres like it's like some kind of like fucking degenerate planet or something and like so there's like but you could play your way through like you know that'd be kind of a cool thing let's have like a drum and bass part obviously a techno part probably funk and like you know you control people even with the fucking genres and like it'd be easy to have themes they go along with it right and tempos um oh i'm also really interested in like okay you know like that simply drawn super mario brothers one like water where it's just like literally they show a curve you know curvy shape on top and color blue and the lava is just that but red like make shit like bright green and like you know teal and purple you know my shit but like especially liquids and we've discussed this before liquids lit from below in like crepuscular rays i think you know what crepuscular rays are like shit like that dude and like what about a lot of all that's like just like moss and pine or like especially moss the other day when we were talking about ivory brass like like for instance those are two materials that like brass is pretty common but like nobody really cares about brass specifically right like half the time they'll have to be like oh i thought you're talking about bronze you know but like ivory that's different because it has this like old school i mean i associate it with this which is like gives it a luxury branding you know but i don't like all the animal killing but it's cool you know the idea of combining a non-precious metal with a really you know like what are some other weird materials combinations like i don't know cinnamon and leather but like materials like glycerin and quartz like it has to be durable things like are there any like substances that are like okay you know how like you can liquefy it here and then you can actually freeze uh you know gases but like as soon as they go back to standard temperature pressure you know even out of that range they're reverting back but there are some like phase changes that are not like symmetrical like that or whatever like i don't i don't think hysteresis is the word i'm looking for but anyway like i can imagine that there are like configurations maybe phase changes isn't the word in this case but like materials from a material science standpoint like configurations are of crystalline whatever or even just like springs in a fucking model that take a lot of you have to put a bunch of energy in to get it to lock to get that state but it can conceivably lock into it and kind of like it would then take energy to pop it out of that like sort of like um snap bracelets kind of like it's the just do the topology you know press it press press it and then boom it snaps in that one way but then if you hit it with enough active energy activation energy it undoes all that right um is there like the equivalent of like a liquid that you could freeze via pressure like compressing it until it crystallizes and then it stays that way uh despite temperature i mean well without i'm not talking about heating it up but just like like is there is there a gas that conceivably would exist as a gas if it just was in you know not dense form and but then if you pressed it together mechanically would eventually form a liquid and if you press that liquid together maybe if you form a solid and it was just happy to stay that way because like you know you could make a toy like that pieces of cotton kind of work like that right but you could easily make a like a toy with a geometry that if you threw a bunch of them on the floor like jacks or legos that like they would spread all over and they wouldn't spontaneously conglomerate but if you started kicking around in there they'd probably start sticking together depending on how you design the surface and then they wouldn't spontaneously separate but then again they're not you know experiencing statistical micro mechanics or whatever the fuck however the gas laws work um so all that can you crank me on some nes levels thank you","role":"user"},{"content":"Got it — you’re asking about what the “standard” number of MLP (feedforward) layers should be inside a transformer block.\n\nShort answer: **there’s no single universal number**, but most modern transformer architectures — including GPT, LLaMA, and similar — use **one MLP block per transformer layer**, and each MLP itself is usually **just two feedforward layers** (sometimes counted as one \"feedforward module\" since it’s usually linear → activation → linear).\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n* * *\n\n### **Typical Transformer Block Structure**\n\n1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention**\n2.  **Feedforward / MLP module**\n    *   Linear (input → hidden, usually 4× hidden size)\n    *   Nonlinearity (ReLU, GELU, or SwiGLU in newer models)\n    *   Linear (hidden → input size)\n\nThis means:\n\n*   **One feedforward block per transformer block**\n*   **Inside that block, two dense layers**\n*   If you count layers literally: each transformer block has **2 MLP layers** in the feedforward section.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Variations**\n\n*   **SwiGLU / Gated MLPs** (PaLM, LLaMA v2, Falcon): Instead of a plain activation, they split the hidden layer into two parallel linear transformations, one gated by a nonlinearity.\n*   **DeepNet-style feedforward**: Some architectures increase the number of MLP layers beyond 2 per block for better depth efficiency.\n*   **Universal Transformers**: Reuse the same block multiple times (effectively increasing MLP depth without adding more parameters per step).\n\n* * *\n\n✅ **Rule of thumb**:  \nIf you’re implementing a GPT-like model, **use one feedforward (2-layer MLP) per transformer block** with hidden size = `4 × model_dim` (or `8/3 × model_dim` in some newer designs) and GELU/SwiGLU activation.\n\nIf you want, I can give you **a table of MLP sizes per dimension** that matches common transformer scaling laws so your model ends up in the “standard” range.  \nDo you want me to make that table?","role":"assistant"}]}
