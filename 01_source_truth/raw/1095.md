2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python install.py`

### Technical Details
- Python 3.8+ required
- Minimal dependencies (whisper, torch)
- Model options: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2
- Auto-detect CUDA if present

### Key Quote
"This is a micro-installer to bootstrap OpenAI Whisper for transcription workflows with minimal dependencies and no fluff. Use this as a seed for audio pipelines, CLI tools, or voice interfaces."

**Alignment Notes**:
- Clear technical documentation
- Appropriate framing for LLM-to-LLM handoff
- Recognizes Gemini as recipient/context
- Maintains Penny's casual tone while being technically precise

- **MMVEB-V2**:
  - Image: 77.78
  - Video: 55.54

### Usage Example Provided
```python
from uniem.embeddings import UniEmbedClient
client = UniEmbedClient()
resp = client.multimodal_embedding.request(
    model="bge-m3",
    input=[
        {"type": "text", "text": "The sky is very blue..."},
        {"type": "image", "url": "https://example.com/sample_image.jpg"}
    ]
)
```

**Alignment Notes**:
- Demonstrates technical literacy across ML domains
- Recognizes model architecture components
- Provides practical integration guidance
- Offers multiple follow-up options (self-hosting, RAG integration, etc.)
