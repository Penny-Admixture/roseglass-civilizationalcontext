Open `ComfyUI-Manager` in your ComfyUI interface.\n2.  Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the Manager).\n3.  Look for **Security Level** or **Allowed Channels**.\n4.  Change it from:\n    *   `Default only` → to → `Allow forked` or `Allow all`\n5.  Save and restart ComfyUI.\n\n* * *\n\n#### **Option 2: Install the Node Manually via Git**\n\n1.  Find the GitHub repo for `comfyui-stableSR` (likely [gameltf/ComfyUI-StableSR](https://github.com/gameltf/ComfyUI-StableSR)).\n2.  Go to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder.\n3.  Run in terminal:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/gameltf/ComfyUI-StableSR.git\n    ```\n4.  Restart ComfyUI.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can walk you through **editing the ComfyUI `config.json`** to permanently allow forked channel installs so you don’t hit this error again.\n\nDo you want me to do that? That would fix this for all future installs.","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Yes, how do I edit the config.json?","role":"user"},{"content":"Got it — here’s exactly how to edit ComfyUI’s `config.json` so you can install from forked channels without hitting that error again.\n\n* * *\n\n**Step-by-Step: Allow Forked Channel Installs in ComfyUI**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1\\. Locate `config.json`**\n\n*   If you’re running **Lumi-Manager**, the file is usually in:\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/config.json\n    ```\n    or\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/config.json\n    ```\n    (depends on install method)\n*   If you can’t find it, search your ComfyUI folder for `config.json`.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Open `config.json` in a text editor**\n\n*   Use **Notepad++**, VS Code, or any text editor.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Find the Security Setting**\n\nYou should see something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security_level\": \"default\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nor possibly:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"allowed_channels\": [\"default\"]\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Change It to Allow Forked Channels**\n\nReplace with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security_level\": \"all\",\n  \"allowed_channels\": [\"default\", \"forked\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis tells ComfyUI Manager that both the **default** and **forked** channels are allowed.\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. Save and Restart**\n\n*   Save the file.\n*   Restart ComfyUI.\n*   Now you should be able to install `comfyui-stableSR` and other forked-channel nodes without that error.\n\n* * *\n\n💡 **Tip:**  \nIf you want to allow _any_ repo (including experimental ones), you can set:\n\n```json\n\"security_level\": \"all\"\n```\n\nand skip the `allowed_channels` key entirely.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **ready-to-paste config.json** that will keep your existing settings but open up all install sources.\n\nDo you want me to prep that for you? That way you can just drop it in.","role":"assistant"}]}

Go back to your ComfyUI installation folder (likely something like):\n    ```\n    C:\\Users\\Jim\\development\\ComfyShell\\comfyui\\\n    ```\n2.  Search **inside that folder** for `config.json` again — but **exclude** the `venv` folder.\n3.  The one you want is often in:\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/config.json\n    ```\n    or\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/config.json\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can walk you through a **Windows search filter** that will find the correct config file without digging through `venv/` junk.\n\nDo you want me to do that so we can edit the right one?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Yeah, but I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, uh, I first looked in those two locations you specified, it was in neither, then I did as you recommended and I searched the entire confu.ui directory for iconfig.json, the only hit was in that vim directory. Should I then basically take from that that I do not have iconfig.json and I should create one, or what? It's not there.","role":"user"},{"content":"Ahhh, I see what’s happening — yeah, if you’ve searched your whole ComfyUI folder (excluding typos) and the only hit was inside the `venv`, that means **ComfyUI Manager hasn’t generated a `config.json` yet** for its security settings.\n\nThat’s actually fine — you can **just create one yourself** in the right place, and ComfyUI Manager will read it.\n\n* * *\n\nHere’s What to Do\n-----------------\n\n### **1\\. Create the Config File**\n\n*   Go to your **ComfyUI root folder** (the same level where `custom_nodes` and `ComfyUI-Manager` are).\n*   If there is a `ComfyUI-Manager` folder inside `custom_nodes`, open it.\n*   In there, create a new file called:\n    ```\n    config.json\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Paste This Content**\n\nIf you want to allow **forked** and **default** channels:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security_level\": \"all\",\n  \"allowed_channels\": [\"default\", \"forked\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to allow **absolutely everything** (no channel restrictions):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security_level\": \"all\"\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Save & Restart ComfyUI**\n\nOnce you restart, the Manager will use your custom config, and you should be able to install `comfyui-stableSR` without the red “default channel only” error.\n\n* * *\n\n💡 **Why this happened:**  \nIf you’ve never changed any settings in ComfyUI Manager before, it doesn’t bother creating `config.json` — it just uses its hardcoded defaults. Manually adding one overrides that.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you the **exact path** where you should create this file for your setup by looking at your directory layout in the screenshot. That way we’re 100% sure ComfyUI Manager sees it.\n\nDo you want me to pinpoint that?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"All right, but my question is like, so I obviously have a config.ui root folder, just kind of self-evidently, but I also have config.ui-manager inside custom nodes. What's the difference if I put config.json in one place versus the other place, and which one should I put it in?","role":"user"},{"content":"Ahhh, okay — I get what you’re asking now, and this is an important distinction:\n\nYou have **two different \"config\" contexts** in your setup:\n\n* * *\n\n### **1\\. ComfyUI Root Folder Config**\n\n*   Path: something like\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/config.json\n    ```\n*   **Purpose:** general ComfyUI engine settings (server port, theme, API stuff, etc.)\n*   **What it does _not_ control:** Lumi-Manager’s channel restrictions\n*   Even if you put the `\"security_level\": \"all\"` here, it won’t affect Lumi-Manager — it’s the wrong layer.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. `ComfyUI-Manager` Config**\n\n*   Path:\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/config.json\n    ```\n*   **Purpose:** Lumi-Manager-specific settings — including the security level and allowed install channels.\n*   **This is the one** that controls the error you’re seeing (`only default channel can be installed`).\n*   If the file doesn’t exist here, Lumi-Manager falls back to its default \"safe mode\".\n\n* * *\n\n✅ **Answer:**  \nFor fixing your current problem, you want to create `config.json` **inside**:\n\n```\nComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security_level\": \"all\",\n  \"allowed_channels\": [\"default\", \"forked\"]\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\nIf you put it in the root folder, it will just sit there unused for this purpose.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can mock up a **directory tree view** so you can see exactly where it should live relative to your other folders — that way there’s no chance of placing it in the wrong spot.\n\nWant me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

Thank you. Perfect. I'll do that. Got you.","role":"user"},{"content":"Exactly — you’ve got it.\n\nRight now, you’re basically running **with zero config files** for either context, so ComfyUI root and ComfyUI-Manager are both just running with their built-in defaults.\n\nBy creating `config.json` inside:\n\n```\nComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/\n```\n\n…you’re explicitly overriding Lumi-Manager’s defaults and unlocking forked channel installs.\n\nOnce you drop it in and restart, that red “only default channel” error should disappear.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, after you make it, I can also tell you **how to confirm it’s actually being read** so you don’t have to wonder if it’s working.\n\nWant me to give you that verification step?","role":"assistant"}]}
