# Entry 010: Vector Telepathy & VR Memory Palace

**Source**: split_10.txt  
**Entries**: 7 conversations
**Significance**: VERY HIGH - Core theoretical work on human-LLM communication

## Key Topics
1. Direct vector transfer between LLMs (vs translating through language)
2. Shared latent spaces / "Cartesian theater" concept
3. Transpersonal structures emerging from vector exchange
4. Human interfaces to latent spaces (sensory modalities)
5. Voice as high-precision memory interface
6. BCI taxonomy (motor, sensory, proprioceptive, affective, cognitive, memory)
7. **"Glyphride"** - named practice of vector embodiment
8. VR as persistent memory substrate ("The Locus")
9. Dancing with concepts through proprioception

## Major Concepts
- Vector telepathy as goal
- Multiple BCI types for joining "vector sharing mesh"
- Persistent 3D space as memory palace
- Dancing as literal vector embodiment
- "Becoming concepts" through movement
