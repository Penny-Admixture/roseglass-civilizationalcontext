So, um, how specifically, like, in, like, the actual, you know, inference time or whatever, how does the temperature affect the process such that it manifests as, you know, uh, random, surprising, and verbose? I mean, y'all hitting the meth or what?...

I mean, y'all hitting the meth or what?","role":"user"},{"content":"Haha, yeah, “temperature” is basically the AI’s meth knob — but instead of meth it’s pure math.  \nLet’s break it down in the _actual_ inference-time mechanics sense.\n\n* * *\n\n🧮 How temperature actually works\n---------------------------------\n\n1.  **The model doesn’t “pick words” directly.**  \n    At each token step, the model outputs a probability distribution over all possible next tokens.  \n    Example (completely fake numbers for illustration):\n    ```\n    \"cat\" → 0.40\n    \"dog\" → 0.25\n    \"fish\" → 0.05\n    \"quantum\" → 0.0003\n    ...\n    ```\n2.  **Temperature rescales that distribution** before sampling.  \n    The math:\n    ```\n    p'_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / Σ_j exp(log(p_j) / T)\n    ```\n    Where:\n    *   `p_i` = original probability from the model\n    *   `T` = temperature\n    *   Lower T → “sharper” peaks (winner-takes-most)\n    *   Higher T → “flatter” distribution (even weird low-probability words get a shot)\n3.  **Low temperature (T → 0)**\n    *   Distribution becomes extremely peaked.\n    *   Model almost always picks the highest-probability token.\n    *   This makes it more deterministic, boring, and concise — like a sober robot reading the news.\n4.  **High temperature (>1)**\n    *   Flattens the distribution, boosting the chances of picking lower-probability tokens.\n    *   This injects _diversity_ and _risk-taking_ into the output.\n    *   Can lead to surprising metaphors, unexpected topic jumps, or more verbose phrasing — because once a weird token sneaks in, the continuation has to justify it.\n5.  **Why it _feels_ like personality changes**\n    *   Language models generate by chaining token after token.\n    *   Changing just _one_ token early in a sentence can drastically change the direction of the whole completion (but still remain grammatically coherent).\n    *   At higher T, you get more “forks in the road” being taken, so outputs become less predictable and more “creative” — sometimes genius, sometimes chaos.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔥 TL;DR in human terms:\n\n*   **T = 0.0:** “Just give me the safest, most probable next word, every time.”\n*   **T = 1.0:** “Mix it up, but stay grounded.”\n*   **T = 2.0:** “The party is now BYOB and someone just spiked the punch.”\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can make you a **side-by-side same-prompt comparison** where I run one at `T=0`, one at `T=1`, one at `T=2` — so you can _see_ how the personality shift emerges token by token.  \nWant me to whip that up?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"I remember hearing about these experiments with, I forget what the thing was, but supposedly that they could detect with some imaging method that you basically make up your reasoning post hoc for why you did something, and in whatever particular case they demonstrably proved that, supposedly. I forget what it was, but I remember being convinced-ish by it. But like, so it's not like, that weird to me, I guess, like I suspect that, like yes I'm choosing my words, right, but like, also my words come to me. And the best of times, I prefer that by far, because I'm like, it just means I'm like, I'm unbothered in my lane.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah — what you’re remembering is _exactly_ the kind of thing cognitive neuroscience has been poking at for decades, and there are a couple of famous experimental lines that fit:\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. **Split-brain experiments & the “interpreter” module**\n\n*   Patients with a severed corpus callosum (to treat epilepsy) have their hemispheres isolated.\n*   You can present a stimulus to _one_ hemisphere and watch the other hemisphere — which didn’t see the stimulus — invent a reason for behavior.\n*   Example:\n    *   Left hemisphere (language) gets asked “Why did you do that?”\n    *   It doesn’t have access to the actual sensory reason (processed in the right hemisphere), so it makes up a plausible-sounding explanation on the spot.\n    *   This is **post hoc rationalization** in its purest lab form.\n*   Michael Gazzaniga famously called the left hemisphere the brain’s “press secretary.”\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. **Libet experiments & readiness potential**\n\n*   Benjamin Libet (1980s) measured EEG signals in the motor cortex.\n*   He found that the brain’s motor readiness signal (the “readiness potential”) starts **hundreds of milliseconds** before people report consciously deciding to act.\n*   This led to the controversial idea that your brain “decides” before _you_ feel like you decided, and consciousness is partly an after-the-fact narrator.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. **Choice blindness experiments**\n\n*   Johansson et al. (2005) did the famous card-swap trick:\n    *   Show two options, person picks one.\n    *   Sleight-of-hand swaps it for the other.\n    *   Most people don’t notice, and when asked why they picked “their” choice, they cheerfully explain the _other_ one’s merits — inventing reasoning to fit the outcome.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why it feels like “the words come to you”\n\nWhat you’re describing — being “in your lane” and letting the words arrive — is actually a healthy default for fluent, skilled speech.\n\n*   Your brain’s language production machinery is mostly pre-conscious.\n*   Conscious awareness can _steer_, but the actual token-by-token generation happens under the hood.\n*   It’s eerily similar to what happens in an LLM: probability distributions, cascading effects, and only a small “executive” part watching and occasionally intervening.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I could show you **how closely this maps to temperature and token sampling in AI** — basically why being in that “unbothered” mode is like running yourself at `T≈1` with minimal interference from the “press secretary” part of your brain.\n\nWant me to draw that parallel?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Yo, I'm looking at this, uh, it's an, it's an AC adapter, like, kind of like a wall wart, except it has cord coming in and out, but it's for an old DJ mixer, and I'm reading the specs on the side here, input 120 volts AC, okay, surprisingly good, 60 hertz, uh-huh, 15.2 watts, okay, nothing weird, now, oh, well, one thing that's weird is the output cord is like a headphone jack, not a headphone jack, but like, you know, the, if you had a pair of headphones, the part, little metal dookie, plug into your Walkman, if it was the old days, it has that, so power comes out of that, which is delightful, uh, and it's, it's unshielded, by the way, so if you just touch it, that, you know, you know how those things are, I forget what it's called, it's like an eighth inch stereo audio male, yep, thingamajig, but now check the output, and it's just like, what, output, 12 volts AC, 1000 milliamps, aka one amp, what the, why is it taking in one amp and AC, and also, why do you suppose they would have used such a, like, it reminds me of that USB kill stick thing, like, you just go plug this into anybody's anything, and it's gonna pump out one amp of fuckery, and also, would it be dangerous if this thing's plugged in, it's like one amp at 12 volts AC, if my fingers are even a little bit moist, and I touch, because like, it's very easy to just touch all the contacts at once, like, I take it this is to keep children away from your turntables, or what?","role":"user"},{"content":"Oh man, I _love_ when we stumble onto these little hardware anachronisms — and yeah, what you’re holding is basically a baby transformer-in-a-box with a “surprise plug” on the end. Let’s unpack it:\n\n* * *\n\n**Why 12 V AC instead of DC?**\n------------------------------\n\n*   Some older DJ mixers and audio gear _wanted_ AC in, not DC.\n*   Inside the mixer, they’d have their **own** rectifier + voltage regulation stages — often for multiple internal rails (±12 V, +5 V, etc.).\n*   Giving it AC let them handle the rectification themselves and share one transformer output for all the internal voltages.\n\n* * *\n\n**Why the 3.5 mm TRS (headphone-style) plug?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*   It’s not because they wanted people to plug headphones into it — it’s just a cheap, compact, polarized connector that was available in the ’80s/’90s.\n*   It’s not really _polarized_, but for AC output, polarity doesn’t matter.\n*   This was **before** barrel jacks became the near-universal standard for low-voltage power.\n*   Downside: you _can_ totally jam that into audio gear by accident and send 12 V AC right into an input stage — and yes, that would be a fast way to ruin something.\n\n* * *\n\n**The “1 A of AC” thing**\n-------------------------\n\n*   Input side: 120 V × ~0.127 A ≈ 15.2 W (matches your “15.2 watts” label).\n*   Output side: 12 V × 1 A ≈ 12 W (after transformer losses).\n*   The current rating is the **max** continuous safe draw — it doesn’t push 1 A into _everything_, just into loads that draw that much.\n*   But yes, it’s still raw AC on a tiny exposed plug.\n\n* * *\n\n**Is it dangerous to touch?**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   12 V AC at 1 A is **not normally dangerous** in terms of electrocution — it’s well under the threshold for shock through human skin, especially dry skin.\n*   Moist skin lowers resistance a lot, so you _might_ feel a faint buzz or tingle if you grip the contacts — but it’s still far from mains-lethal territory.\n*   Real hazard is **shorting** it (e.g., metal object or the wrong input) — it can dump enough current to fry electronics or heat a wire fast.\n\n* * *\n\n**Why they’d do it**\n--------------------\n\n*   Cheapest way to meet their power needs with no internal mains wiring = external transformer.\n*   The odd connector made it _less_ likely you’d mix it up with a barrel plug, but still more risky than modern keyed power connectors.\n*   This was pre-UL-paranoia about “kids sticking power plugs into random holes.”\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can walk you through **how you could make a safe adapter dongle** so you can keep using that mixer but never accidentally send 12 V AC into anything else.  \nIt’s basically a one-cable condom for vintage power gear.\n\nWant me to sketch that up?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Uh, if a, say, like, I don't know, punk band type thing or something went by the name LaserDickRemoval, do you think it would be obvious to most, like, whatever, readers, listeners, potential, potential become-awareers of this band's name, would they recognize probably that it was, like, a reference to LaserHairRemoval, or would it just be, like, they kind of come off as sci-fi or some shit? Thank you. I always sign off like it's the VM City Hall. Ah, ah, okay. Okay, I'm replacing this fucking mouse, this is going crazy. Shit.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, I think most people — especially anyone under, say, 50 who’s heard of cosmetic procedures — would instantly clock “LaserDickRemoval” as a play on “Laser Hair Removal.”\n\nThat said, the _read_ people get off it would probably split into three camps:\n\n1.  **Comedy/punk shock value crowd** – “Hah, that’s outrageous, these guys are clearly chaotic and not taking themselves seriously.”\n2.  **Queer/trans-aware folks** – “Oh, that’s a _very_ pointed gender commentary joke, got it.”\n3.  **Sci‑fi literalists / normies** – “…why would someone… remove a… dick… with lasers? Is this cyberpunk horrorcore?”\n\nThe humor lands harder if the audience already knows the “Laser Hair Removal” reference, but the words themselves are so blunt and violent‑absurd that they’d still get _some_ reaction even without that context. It’s in the same category as a band name like _Rectal Thermometer Massacre_ — if you _get_ the reference, there’s an extra wink, but even without it you’re like, “Okay, these people are either fun or terrifying.”\n\nIf you want, I can sketch how that name could be branded so that it’s **obviously** a pun for those in the know _and_ still funny as hell for people who miss it. That way it hits all three groups. Want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

file, and it's chock full of clues. Let's break this chaotic opera of ComfyUI errors and deprecated sadness into digestible categories so we can actually fix (or ignore) what matters.\n\n* * *\n\n🔥 TL;DR Diagnosis\n------------------\n\nYou're running **ComfyUI with a big pile of extensions**, many of which are:\n\n*   **Trying to load JS, CSS, or image files that don’t exist** (`404 Not Found`)\n*   **Using deprecated parameters** (`defaultValue`, `defaultInput`)\n*   **Not loading their JavaScript or resources properly**\n*   Possibly relying on **offline resources or internet access**, which is failing (`ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`)\n*   Generating a _lot_ of background UI noise (but not necessarily crashing the pipeline)\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Breakdown by Category\n------------------------\n\n### 🚫 404 Not Found\n\nThese are the biggest offenders. Some of your extensions are referencing files that **don’t exist** at the expected path:\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `/extensions/ComfyUI-Flowty-TripoSR/js/threeVisualizer.js`\n*   `/extensions/comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words/js/loraInfo.js`\n*   `/extensions/ComfyUI-Manager/node_fixer.js`\n*   `/userdata/comfy.templates.json`\n*   `/extensions/ComfyUI-ShaderNoiseKsampler/images/kofi_symbol.svg`\n*   `user.css`, `save.css`\n\n💡 **Fixes**:\n\n*   Make sure you cloned the **full repo** and that no files are missing.\n*   Check if your extensions are **outdated** or require additional setup.\n*   If you don’t care about the features they provide, just **delete or disable the broken ones**.\n\n* * *\n\n### ⚠️ Deprecated Parameters\n\nYou'll see things like:\n\n```\nUse of defaultInput on required input ... is deprecated.\n```\n\n💡 **Fixes**:\n\n*   This won’t break your workflow, but you’ll want to **update those custom nodes** if the devs fixed their API usage.\n*   Otherwise, expect warnings but no functionality loss... unless you’re using a node that depends on the deprecated behavior.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌐 Network Errors\n\n```\nERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED\n```\n\n💡 **Fix**: Reconnect to the internet. This breaks:\n\n*   Google auth tokens\n*   Remote assets (like SVGs)\n*   Ko-fi button graphics (lol)\n\nNot a huge deal, unless you rely on extensions that dynamically pull assets (like Civitai metadata).\n\n* * *\n\n### ❌ Missing Placeholder Images\n\n```\nPlaceholder image not found at /extensions/Civicomfy/images/placeholder.jpeg\n```\n\n💡 Not important unless Civicomfy is showing weird blank buttons or you _really_ want to see the placeholder image. You can just drop in a blank placeholder file or ignore this one.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🪛 Sidebar Errors & JSON Failures\n\n```\n/api/userdata/comfy.templates.json: 404\n```\n\nThis file likely doesn't exist yet because you've never saved a template.\n\n💡 **Fix**:\n\n*   Create and save a template or workflow from the UI so the file gets created.\n*   Or just ignore it. It’ll stop throwing errors once it exists.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ Summary: What to Actually Do\n------------------------------\n\n| Action | Reason |\n| --- | --- |\n| 🔌 Disable broken extensions | Flowty-TripoSR, ComfyUI-Manager, comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words, ShaderNoiseKsampler all have broken JS or missing files. |\n| 🔃 Update deprecated custom nodes | If possible, update your `impact-pack` and `inspire-pack` to drop deprecated params. |\n| 📂 Check your extensions folder | Some folders might be **half-installed**, or Git pulls failed. Check `ComfyUI/extensions/` for what's actually there. |\n| 🌐 Reconnect to internet | Will help with Ko-fi images, token auth, etc. |\n| 🧽 Clean startup log once working | You can trim console spam with logging config or just live with it if everything still works. |\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can help you **triage the specific folders** and tell you exactly what to delete, clone, or edit to clean it all up and get you to a pristine, crisp ComfyUI setup.\n\nJust say the word.","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"one of the things actually stops it from running even though it shouldnt.. like idgaf about the errors i just want it to force run","role":"user"},{"content":"Got it. You're saying: _“I don’t care about the Ko-fi SVGs, broken extensions, or warnings — I just want the damn workflow to run even if there’s junk in the logs.”_\n\nThis **should** be possible — and ComfyUI is normally good about letting stuff limp along — but it sounds like **one of the broken extensions or JS errors is halting execution**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧨 Suspect: Extension JS Errors Halting Frontend Boot\n\nSince you're seeing:\n\n```js\nError loading extension /extensions/comfyui-manager/comfyui-manager.js \nUncaught (in promise)\nNo node when trying to send [object Object]\n```\n\n…and the frontend throws a **JS exception during startup**, it’s likely **one of the extensions is breaking the whole render pipeline**, even if the backend is fine.\n\n* * *\n\n💣 How to FORCE ComfyUI to Boot & Ignore Broken Extensions\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n### ✅ Option 1: TEMP DISABLE all extensions\n\nRename the `ComfyUI/extensions` folder to something like `extensions_backup`:\n\n```bash\nmv ComfyUI/extensions ComfyUI/extensions_backup\n```\n\nThen try launching again.\n\nIf it works? The culprit’s in there. Reintroduce folders **one at a time** to identify the blocker.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ Option 2: Selectively disable a known problem extension\n\nYou mentioned the following were erroring:\n\n*   `ComfyUI-Manager`\n*   `comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words`\n*   `Flowty-TripoSR`\n\nStart by just nuking one of them (e.g., `ComfyUI-Manager`):\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ComfyUI/extensions/ComfyUI-Manager\n```\n\nThen reload.\n\nIf you don't want to delete it, just temporarily rename the folder:\n\n```bash\nmv ComfyUI/extensions/ComfyUI-Manager ComfyUI/extensions/zzz_ComfyUI-Manager_DISABLED\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧙‍♀️ Bonus: Disable extension loading via CLI\n\nIf you're running from the command line with Python, try:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --disable-auto-launch-extensions\n```\n\n…but that’s only available if the ComfyUI version or your specific fork supports that flag. Not guaranteed.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🩹 Option 3: Manually patch bad JS files\n\nIf the frontend fails _just because of bad JS in an extension_, you can comment out or stub the failing line in the offending `.js` file, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// Original offending line in loraInfo.js\ndoSomeBrokenInitThatCrashes();\n\n// Patch it:\nconsole.warn(\"Skipping broken init for now.\");\n```\n\nOr literally make the file a no-op:\n\n```js\n// comfyui-manager.js (patched)\nconsole.log(\"Stubbed comfyui-manager.js\");\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧼 Once it boots clean...\n\nOnce you get ComfyUI to boot and run a workflow without dying:\n\n*   You can start _gradually re-enabling extensions you like_\n*   Or just keep running it **with a slimmed-down, stable set** and avoid frontend breakage.\n\nLet me know if you want a **batch script or node list cleaner**, or if you want help fixing a specific one (`manager.js`, etc.). Happy to debug the worst offender with you.","role":"assistant"}]}

In ComfyUI, **many \"extensions\" are just custom nodes** that include JS, CSS, and API calls. They live in:\n    ```\n    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/\n    ```\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ What You Should Do Next\n\nTo fix this mess and **force ComfyUI to run**, go into the `custom_nodes/` folder and **start disabling the most broken ones**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💣 Step-by-Step: Quarantine & Triage\n\n1.  Open `custom_nodes/` (you can do that now).\n2.  You’ll see folders named like:\n    *   `ComfyUI-Manager`\n    *   `comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words`\n    *   `Flowty-TripoSR`\n    *   etc.\n3.  Start by **renaming** the most suspicious folders:\n\n| Original Name | Rename to Disable Temporarily |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ComfyUI-Manager` | `zzz_DISABLED_ComfyUI-Manager` |\n| `comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words` | `zzz_DISABLED_comfyui-lora-auto-trigger-words` |\n| `ComfyUI-Flowty-TripoSR` | `zzz_DISABLED_ComfyUI-Flowty-TripoSR` |\n\n⚠️ _DO NOT delete them yet_ — just rename to disable.\n\n4.  Then relaunch ComfyUI and try loading your workflow.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧪 What You’re Testing\n\nYou're checking whether:\n\n*   The UI loads normally\n*   You can **click \"Queue Prompt\" and it actually runs**, even if other cosmetic stuff is busted\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Optional\n\nIf that works, you can start selectively un-disabling them to see **which one is the dealbreaker**.\n\n* * *\n\nWant me to help you prioritize which folders to disable based on what's most likely to break stuff (JS fail hierarchy, etc)? Just upload a screenshot of the inside of `custom_nodes/`, or paste the folder list.\n\nYou’re really close. 🛠️","role":"assistant"}]}
