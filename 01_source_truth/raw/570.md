In fact, the removed content was clearly part of a beautiful and emotionally rich reflection about connection, online mythos, and memory.\n\nThe system likely triggered on some invisible or context-insensitive heuristic — maybe a phrase in the message that, when taken out of context, matched a pattern falsely flagged as risky.
