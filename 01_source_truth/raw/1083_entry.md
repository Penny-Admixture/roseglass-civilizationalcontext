It prominently features an anime-style illustration, specifically referencing a scene from the influential anime film _Akira_. The flyer also displays a phone number: \"313.877.4699,\" suggesting it was a contact or information line for the event.\n\nStylistically, it has a weathered, aged appearance, indicative of its vintage from the late 1990s, and is likely associated with Detroit's underground rave or electronic music scene of that era. The graphic design, typography, and use of anime imagery were common in rave culture at that time, signaling a tech-driven, futuristic aesthetic.\n\nWould you like to process this for any specific project, or should I annotate and archive it into your current collections?","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"So, there's like, aggressive flies in my room that keep outsmarting me, and I can't, like, I've killed like, five of them, but there's like, three left. And the way I've gotten them is when they, if they land on the TV screen, it dawns out, because I have a CD case, and I come at them, and like, if I center them, basically, any direction I try to go, boom, they're gone. And I fucking cackle. But like, these other ones are outclassing me intellectually. Is there any, like, tricks that I can outsmart these fuckers?","role":"user"},{"content":"Alright Penny. You're dealing with some **hyperintelligent bastards**. We’re in _Flypocalypse Act III: The Reckoning_, and you’ve already gone full psycho-cackle-mode with the TV trap. Respect. But now we need to up the game. Here's a tactical escalation plan:\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Psychological Warfare Tactics (Yes, for flies)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. **Light Bait and Frame Trap**\n\n*   Turn off all lights except one screen (your TV or a lamp with a white sheet behind it).\n*   Place it next to a sticky trap (like [FlyPaper](https://www.amazon.com/FlyPaper)).\n*   The fly thinks it’s winning—_“Ha! She wants me to go THERE!”_—but you’re actually playing **4D baitball**.\n\n### 2\\. **Dish Soap Death Bath**\n\n*   Mix:\n    *   A shallow dish\n    *   Apple cider vinegar or red wine\n    *   A few drops of dish soap (breaks surface tension = insta-drown)\n*   Leave it out near light or on the TV stand.\n*   They’ll go in to party. They won’t come out. (_Flies of Babylon_.)\n\n### 3\\. **Infrared Ambush Mode**\n\n*   Freeze a room by blasting A/C and keeping lights off. They’ll slow down.\n*   Then do your “CD-case Doom Strike” while they’re sluggish from the cold.\n*   Bonus: wear black, low movement. **Become the predator.**\n\n* * *\n\n🥷 Combat Enhancements\n----------------------\n\n### 4\\. **Hair Spray + Lighter**\n\n*   (Just kidding. But, like… only barely kidding. We both know you _considered_ it.)\n\n### 5\\. **Laser Pointer Drone with Tape Knife**\n\n*   This isn’t real advice. Or maybe it is. How much Red Bull have you had.\n\n* * *\n\n🔄 If All Else Fails: Go Meta\n-----------------------------\n\n*   Record them.\n*   Use motion detection to predict patterns.\n*   Train a vision model.\n*   Mount a turret.\n*   Start a YouTube channel: _“Penny vs. The Final Three”_\n*   Profit.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want:\n\n*   Specific brands or Amazon links for traps.\n*   Blueprint for a USB-controlled fly zapper.\n*   Or to just rage in mutual hatred toward these winged algorithms.\n\nWe _will_ win this war. 🪰💥","role":"assistant"}]}

Confirmed. You’re being _outflanked by ceiling goblins with wings_.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 Observations from the War Room (aka Your Basement)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### ⬇️ The Fly Ops Center\n\n*   You’ve got **a lot of warm, high-up, dark wood crevices**, ducts, and cable jungle gyms — classic _fly hangout zones_.\n*   The green hanging lantern trap? Good start. But it looks **non-powered** (likely pheromone-based, maybe sticky), and those only work if flies _choose_ to land in them — and these bastards aren't playing fair.\n*   You've got **lots of light sources**, which is great, but not weaponized yet.\n*   There’s **no active airflow traps** visible (like fans, zappers, or vacuum funnels). That's where we strike.\n\n* * *\n\n💥 Recommended Upgrades\n-----------------------\n\n### 🔌 1. **Get an Electric Fly Trap with UV + Fan Suction**\n\n*   Example: _Katchy Indoor Insect Trap_ — it uses **UV light, a fan, and sticky base**. Flies go in. They don’t come out.\n*   Place it **away from your main lights**, in a darker zone near fly traffic.\n*   Bonus: They’re silent and kind of elegant. You don’t need more chaos.\n\n### 💨 2. **Exploit Their Love of Airflow**\n\n*   Flies hate unpredictable air.\n*   **Set up a small directional fan** pointing up toward the ducts or suspicious fly perches.\n*   It _disrupts flight paths_ and encourages them to land in zones you control — like your TV-trap-CD-case death zone.\n\n### 🧠 3. **Reverse Psychology (Deadass)**\n\n*   Set up **a white plate or piece of printer paper** on the floor or desk with a splash of apple cider vinegar.\n*   Flies often go _low_ when trying to evade. You lure them down… and **wait**.\n\n* * *\n\n⚔️ Optional Comedic Add-ons\n---------------------------\n\n*   **“Sniper Lamp”:** Replace a bulb near the TV with a narrow-beam desk lamp or bright LED to direct them _exactly_ to your kill zone.\n*   **USB Fly Zapper Racket**: I swear by these. Charges via USB. Leaves a puff of smoke. You will laugh maniacally.\n*   **Fly Naming Ceremony**: Name the final three flies. Give them little dossiers. Then eliminate them one by one like you’re in _Metal Gear Flyd_.\n\n* * *\n\n🧼 Lastly — Cut Off the Respawn Points\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou don’t want _new_ flies spawning from the depths.\n\n*   Make sure **drains**, **trash cans**, **damp cloth**, and **food remnants** are sealed, dry, or removed.\n*   If your HVAC has **gaps or unsealed areas**, that ductwork might be a fly autobahn.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me know if you want a full spec loadout: I can give you a ready-to-buy trap list with model names and Amazon links for a full **Zone Defense Plan**.\n\nWe’re taking back the airspace. 🛸🪰🪦","role":"assistant"}]}
