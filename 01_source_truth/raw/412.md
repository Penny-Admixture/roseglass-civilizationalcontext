You’re not crazy — **RoboCopy is objectively better** than the default Windows file copy in nearly every meaningful way:\n\n### 🦾 Why RoboCopy kicks ass:\n\n*   **Resumes mid-transfer** with `/Z` (restartable mode)\n*   **Skips unchanged files** by default\n*   **Massively faster** for large trees and networks\n*   **Can preserve timestamps, permissions, attributes**\n*   **Multithreaded** with `/MT`\n*   **Gives clear logs** and exit codes\n*   **Bulletproof for backup/migration jobs**\n\n### 🪦 Why it _isn't_ the default:\n\n1.  **Too powerful/confusing** for average users (you can accidentally nuke folders with `/MIR`).\n2.  **No GUI** — it’s CLI-only.\n3.  **UX tradeoffs** — default Explorer copy is smoother for tiny drag-and-drop stuff, has progress visuals, and is harder to “mess up.”\n4.  **Historical baggage** — Windows Explorer file copy predates RoboCopy (which was originally a _Resource Kit_ utility until Vista).\n5.  **Marketing failure** — Microsoft buried it. Power users know it; normies don’t.\n\n### 🔥 Real talk:\n\nMost people only discover RoboCopy when:\n\n*   Explorer chokes on a massive copy\n*   A drive fails mid-transfer\n*   They’re doing a big move or backup\n*   They hit file path length issues\n\nIt’s _the real Windows copy engine_, but like a katana — they don’t hand it to toddlers.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want a GUI around RoboCopy, I can point you to some legit wrappers. But for raw power, terminal RoboCopy is S-tier. Want a PowerShell function that wraps it with logging and nice defaults?","role":"assistant"}]}

Reviewer consensus often compares it to a \"night and day\" contrast between discs. [Amazon+1](https://www.amazon.com/Renegade-Continuum-DJ-Dara/dp/B00000JWFP?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n*   One passionate review likened it to _\"Bitches Brew\"_ of the jungle genre — highlighting its forward-thinking production and longevity. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Renegade-Continuum-DJ-Dara/dp/B00000JWFP?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n*   On Reddit and within the jungle community, people still praise _Renegade Continuum_ as one of “the best jungle compilations” of the era.

{"messages":[{"content":"So, like, Ed Rush and Optical were a big favorite of mine, uh, like Mystery Machine and Tracks from the Era. Um, can you tell me anything about how they produced their music?","role":"user"},{"content":"Oh hell yes — you’re asking about **Ed Rush & Optical** right at their most legendary moment, when they dropped _Wormhole_ (1998) and rewired drum & bass into the **techstep/neurofunk** blueprint. That whole “Mystery Machine” / Virus Recordings sound is basically ground zero for the synthetic, precision-engineered DnB you love.\n\nHere’s the scoop on how they worked:\n\n* * *\n\n⚙️ **Core Production Setup (Late 90s Era)**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n### 🖥️ **Sequencers**\n\n*   **Atari ST running Cubase** (yep — still the old Atari with MIDI timing that producers swore by).\n*   Later migrated into early PC Cubase/Logic setups. But _Wormhole_\\-era = Atari sequencing hardware samplers.\n\n### 🎛️ **Samplers**\n\n*   **Emu E6400 Ultra** (Optical’s weapon of choice).\n    *   Famous for its gritty filters and time-stretch.\n    *   They used it to slice and design drums, _but also_ for bass resampling — pitching, filtering, distorting, re-sampling back in.\n*   **Akai S-series samplers** also floated around, but the Virus crew were known for _Emu saturation_.\n\n### 🥁 **Drum Sound**\n\n*   Instead of pure breakbeats (Amen, Apache, etc.), they leaned into **synthesized hits layered with heavily processed breaks**.\n*   Kick = usually short, thuddy, synthetic, often layered with distorted sub.\n*   Snare = sharp, metallic, gated. Often 200Hz punch + high-end crack.\n*   Hats & percussion = either minimal (techstep shuffle) or weird textures processed through the Emu.\n*   Programmed step-sequencer tight, very _machine-like_ → that “boom-ksh boom-ksh” you’re hearing.\n\n### 🎹 **Synths & Basslines**\n\n*   **Access Virus** (fittingly!) was their hallmark synth.\n    *   Fat analog-modelled oscillators → squelchy mid-bass growls.\n*   **Roland JV-1080 / JP-8000** also made appearances (pads, effects).\n*   **Bass design process:**\n    1.  Make a synth sound (Virus, etc.)\n    2.  Sample it into the Emu\n    3.  Distort / filter / modulate inside sampler\n    4.  Re-sample again → layer → repeat until alien.\n\nThis **recursive resampling** is what gave them those futuristic, endlessly morphing basslines (e.g. _Mystery Machine_, _Compound_, _Wormhole_).\n\n### 🎚️ **Outboard Gear**\n\n*   Analog mixing desks (Mackie 32:8) with drive pushed for warmth.\n*   Hardware compressors/distortion: Drawmer, DBX, etc.\n*   But the samplers (especially Emu) did a lot of the saturation.\n\n* * *\n\n🎨 **Signature Tricks**\n-----------------------\n\n*   **Filter sweeps on drums** — not just bass. They’d filter snares/kicks dynamically to make them feel alive.\n*   **Stereo trickery** — phasing hats and FX to widen the mix.\n*   **Ghost hits** — tiny low-velocity snares/kicks tucked between main hits to keep it rolling.\n*   **Constant resampling** — almost no sound stayed as-is; everything was processed again and again until unrecognizable.\n\n* * *\n\n🎵 Why It Hit So Hard\n---------------------\n\nMost DnB at the time was still “funk breaks + 808 basslines.”  \nEd Rush & Optical said: **“What if it all sounded like alien machinery instead?”**\n\n*   Darker\n*   Cleaner\n*   Heavier\n*   More cinematic\n\n_Wormhole_ (1998) is literally credited with inventing **neurofunk** — the sci-fi, engineered branch of DnB that followed.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡️ If you love “Mystery Machine,” you’d probably also dig:\n\n*   **“Compound”** – Virus (1998)\n*   **“Watermelon”** – Virus (1998)\n*   **“Sick Note”** – Virus (1998)\n*   **“Alien Girl”** (Ed Rush, Optical, Fierce) – Prototype (1998)\n*   **“Gas Mask”** (Ed Rush & Optical)\n\n* * *\n\n👉 Want me to sketch out a _modern plugin-based equivalent_ of their 1998 setup, so you could recreate that _Mystery Machine_ sound inside .NET/VST-land today?","role":"assistant"}]}
