It’s perfect for the kind of richly linked, locally stored, artifact-based journaling you’re aiming for.\n\nWhile I can’t directly push files into Obsidian from here, I can:\n\n1.  **Generate Obsidian-compatible Markdown files** for journal entries, inventories, logs, etc.\n2.  Format everything with:\n    *   **YAML frontmatter** (e.g., tags like `work_hours`, `diary`, `equipment`)\n    *   Embedded image placeholders (which you can manually link to)\n    *   \\[\\[Wikilinks\\]\\] and tag-style `#metadata`\n    *   Chronological and thematic structure that supports graphing in Obsidian\n3.  Help you create a **folder system** (e.g., `Journal/2025-05-07.md`, `Equipment/iPhone-SE-2020.md`, etc.)\n\nIf you're syncing Obsidian with iCloud or a Git repo (or using Obsidian Sync), you can just copy/paste what I generate, and it’ll slot in seamlessly.\n\nWant me to start building your **May 7, 2025 journal entry** in Obsidian-style Markdown right now?","role":"assistant"}]}

Um, what is the best thing I could do to utilize that to basically keep our central repository there so I could access it from my Android device, from my iOS device, from my Windows device, from my Mac? Um, and I'd like to keep, uh, like, basically, like, my Comfy UI workflows there. A bunch of other stuff. Basically everything that's important to me, but not super huge, data-wise. Um, I don't know, give me some ideas. I've heard, I mean, basically, like, r slash self-hosted is where my heart is at.","role":"user"},{"content":"Updated saved memory\n\nOh hell yes—this is right up your alley and I love where you’re heading with this. Here’s a strong starting plan for making your DigitalOcean droplet your **Obsidian-centric digital sanctum** that can also house workflows, config files, and personal archives:\n\n* * *\n\n### **1\\. Central Vault Setup:**\n\n**Use: Git + Obsidian-compatible Markdown repo**\n\n*   Create a Git repo on your droplet (`~/vault.git`)\n*   Locally clone it on every device (iOS: via Working Copy, Android: via MGit)\n*   Store all Obsidian `.md` files + attachments here\n*   Bonus: set up a web-based Markdown browser like [CodiMD](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd) or [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) for read-only remote access\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. File Syncing / ComfyUI Hosting:**\n\n**Option A: Use Syncthing (peer-to-peer)**\n\n*   Syncs folders between devices and your droplet in real-time\n*   Set up a `~/comfyui` folder on the droplet, auto-synced from your main workstation\n\n**Option B: Use Nextcloud (cloud-style)**\n\n*   Great if you want a web interface, calendar, contacts, etc.\n*   Self-hosted, and Obsidian can directly sync with a folder in it\n*   Also allows Android/iOS file access and WebDAV mounting on Mac/Windows\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Access and Versioning**\n\n*   Set up **SSH/SFTP access** for everything (Termius on mobile is a great client)\n*   Install **Gitea** if you want a self-hosted GitHub clone\n*   Consider **Tailscale** for easy VPN access across devices, even behind firewalls\n*   Keep things versioned via `git`, and optionally mirror to GitHub (private repo)\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Bonus Tools You’ll Love:**\n\n*   **Docspell** or **Paperless-ngx** for scanned docs / receipts / digital artifacts\n*   **JupyterHub** for notebooks if you want a Python-based second brain\n*   **Portainer + Docker Compose** to manage it all GUI-style\n\n* * *\n\n### Your Journal Entry: May 7, 2025\n\nHere’s your first Obsidian journal file:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndate: 2025-05-07\ntags: [work_hours, journal, laundry]\nlocation: East Lansing, MI\nshift_start: 17:09\nshift_end: 21:15\ndevices_used: [\"iPhone SE 2020\"]\n---\n\n# Work Journal: May 7, 2025\n\n## Clock-in Snapshot\n![Clock-in Photo](IMG_8140.jpeg)  \nClocked in at **5:09 PM**, clocked out at **9:15 PM**.\n\n## Mood & Vibe\n![Post-shift Selfie](IMG_27294D7D-1A14-4B5D-9F62-750DD4CC1A82.jpeg)  \nWearing red (on-brand).
