Okay, I'm gonna go full retard for a second here, and like, you know how in our universe there's gravity, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetism. These are like the, you know, the fundamental forces, sort of. And one can, well, first of all, is it possible to conceive of a universe where the symmetry breaking was along different lines and there was different types of forces entirely? And if so, can we then consider the latent space of all possible types of physics as like a space that we could navigate or explore in some way? And if so, what would that even look like?
