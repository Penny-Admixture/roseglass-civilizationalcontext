{"messages":[{"content":"so how do i get my local llm to do that?  i just reinstalled python like how do I FIX the wacked out windowsapp version alias fuckery","role":"user"},{"content":"You’re asking the exact right question — and now that you’ve reinstalled Python, you’re _one step away_ from fixing this WindowsApp alias hell.\n\n* * *\n\n💣 The Problem Recap:\n---------------------\n\nWindows adds a **fake `python.exe` shim** in:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\n```\n\nThis \"alias\" exists **even if real Python isn't installed**, and it **hijacks `python` calls** in PowerShell, CMD, VS Code, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n✅ GOAL:\n-------\n\n*   Make `python` and `pip` point to your **real, working Python**\n*   Eliminate the WindowsApps hijack\n*   Confirm your LLM tool (e.g. LM Studio, ollama, etc.) uses the correct interpreter\n\n* * *\n\n🧹 Step-by-Step Fix\n-------------------\n\n### ✅ 1. Find the Real Python\n\nAfter your reinstall, you should now have something like:\n\n```\nC:\\Python312\\python.exe\n```\n\nLet’s confirm. Run:\n\n```powershell\n& \"C:\\Python312\\python.exe\" -V\n```\n\n> (Substitute `Python311`, `Python313`, etc., based on your install.)\n\nMake sure **that works** and gives a version number.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ 2. Add Real Python to System PATH\n\nManually:\n\n1.  Press `Win + R` → type `sysdm.cpl`\n2.  Go to **Advanced** tab → click **Environment Variables**\n3.  Under **System variables**, find `Path` → click **Edit**\n4.  At the **top**, add these:\n    ```\n    C:\\Python312\\\n    C:\\Python312\\Scripts\\\n    ```\n5.  Move them **above** any entry like:\n    ```\n    C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\n    ```\n6.  Click OK → OK → OK\n\nThen **restart PowerShell** or any terminal.\n\n* * *\n\n### ❌ 3. Disable the WindowsApps Alias (If Needed)\n\nTo prevent Windows from “helpfully” re-adding its fake `python` launcher:\n\n#### Option A (Safe):\n\nDelete the `python.exe` and `python3.exe` _shortcuts_ in:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\n```\n\n> ⚠️ These are just **stubs**, not real programs. Deleting them won’t break anything if you’ve got a real Python installed.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ 4. Confirm It Works\n\nIn a new terminal, run:\n\n```powershell\nwhere python\n```\n\nAnd:\n\n```powershell\npython -V\npip -V\n```\n\nYou should now see paths like:\n\n```\nC:\\Python312\\python.exe\nC:\\Python312\\Scripts\\pip.exe\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ 5. Make Your LLM Use the Right Python\n\nFor example, if you’re running scripts that power:\n\n*   🧠 Gemma or Mixtral in LM Studio\n*   🧪 Any `.bat` file or `.ps1` script\n*   🪟 Anything Python-related in VS Code\n\nYou can now confidently use:\n\n```powershell\npython memory_cli.py\n```\n\nOr bake the full path:\n\n```powershell\n\"C:\\Python312\\python.exe\" memory_cli.py\n```\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ Want Me to:\n-------------\n\n*   Write you a `.bat` that sets everything right?\n*   Build a wrapper that runs your LLM + memory scripts using your clean Python?\n\nSay the word and I’ll patch your local stack like I live in your terminal.","role":"assistant"}]}
