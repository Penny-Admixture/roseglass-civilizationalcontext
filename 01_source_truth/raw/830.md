{"messages":[{"content":"Okay, random challenge here. So, you know vaguely where my coding skills are at, and like, I need to skill up slash vibe code this shit out of Roblox Studio right quick. I guarantee you probably did not guess that was coming. So, like, the thing is, I need to be able to have... So, you said there's items in the inventory that are tarot cards, is that correct? Different decks? I want to. What happens? No, basically, if you don't have a deck equipped, that just means you're being read to. Okay. So, there's going to be tarot decks to find that are, like, items that a player can have in their inventory. But regardless of if they do or not, there's a default deck that we'll default to. And then the mechanic that we wanted to find is that... So, is the only time they can use these decks when they sit in a special place, or no? Okay, so if the player is in a certain place, do they have to be seated, or is it just the location that matters? Okay, they have to be seated on a specific seat. And if they are, then the behavior loop is going to be, like, if they don't have a deck, then use the default deck. And I'll explain what that means in a second. And if they do have a deck, we're going to use that one. It's just basically... Is it just a theme, or is there, like, functional differences? So, it's just graphically different, but functionally the same. Well, basically I have to swap the skins out. So, now, can you describe what behavior you want to happen game-wise when the player sits down, and we kick this off, what happens? Okay, a GUI pops up. And then I want there to be the cards on the screen. And then I want you to be able to select what kind of draw or spread you want to do. So, you want, like, a drawing of a pile of cards, or do you want a bunch of, like, separate cards out there? A bunch of separate cards to click and draw. And how many cards are in a tarot deck? 78. Okay, and you want them all displayed on screen simultaneously? Okay. I just found a problem. Hold on, it's not a dealbreaker. So, you could have, like, an animation where it, like... I'm thinking something like, you know, like, the Wheel of Fortune, like, how there's a bunch of different things on it. Okay, but not that, but, like, you know, like, if you fan cards out, you can, like, see the corners of them. Like, is there, from looking at any sub-portion of a tarot card, is it possible to identify which one it is? It's not, like, cards where there's a thing in the corner, right? No. So, you'd have to, like, look at the whole thing to know what it is? Yeah. So, basically, here's, like, a back. How about this, dude? Check it out. Say you showed, listen, you said there's 70-something? So, say you showed, like, 15 at a time, and by scrolling the mouse wheel, it'd flip through them all? That would be, like, you could go through them all really quick and find whatever you're looking for. Yeah, but that's not how it works. Okay, I don't know how it works, so can you explain how... Basically, you pick a card at random. Like, I want it to be able to, like, you click, and then it pulls a card at random. Okay, so you don't really... Out of a pool of 70-something cards. So, you don't have to show them all, then, anyway. What you can do is, like, you can actually, literally, have all of them there. And, like, imagine, like... Okay. Imagine, like, a card facing you, and a card behind you, and there's just, like, a circle across the other one. Like, as if they're animated by magic, right? Like a carousel. Right? And so... And it doesn't have to be that geometry. But however you want, you have a whirling thing of the actual 72 cards, but they're not all... They're occluding each other sometimes. Right? But then you can, like, click on it with the mouse, and it slowly comes to a stop, and whatever one's in the front comes in front. Or however you want to animate it. You could have it, like, magically... Well, use your intuition and tell me more, and we can refine the design. Yeah. The point is, it's not impossible to represent that. Right? Okay. And you click it, and just one pops up and says, is this what you got? Okay. Well, that's way easier. Okay. I think, um... I think ChatGPG got all that. I'm imagining it nodding at me. So, yeah. We're gonna go with, yeah. Um... So, it picks the cards. One, two, three, what? One, three, oh... Blank. But I want you to be able to pick, like... If you're limiting, like, tarot spreads, like, past, present, future, you would only be able to draw three cards. Okay. Well, what options do you want to use your ability to select between? Just a span of three cards, and then it'll pull from random, from that pool. Like, each... What do you mean, it spans it? So, the user has one option, the next option, the next option. You need to describe... Three cards on screen. But pull a random card, and have that display that information from that, on that card. In one path, that happens. What's the other ones? Random. They're all random. Different random iterations of the same path are not a different path. That just means roll a RNG. That's one path. The user has no choice, then. It's like chutes and ladders. That's exactly tarot. Okay, well... Like, literally, you just pull a card from a random shuffled deck, and that's what you get. That's what I want. Okay. So we want to just pull three cards at random, correct? Yes, that's what I was trying to say. But we need to make sure that we don't select the same card twice. We can't just use a pure RNG, right? Yeah. Okay. So we need to have some set of them, and then at random select three indexes in this. And then pick those. Okay. I'm sure. I'm a super genius. I can do that. And you want them picked all at once? Or do you want it with some, like... Like one, two, three. Kind of like a display. But you want them all done, and then whatever. Do you interpret them? Yeah. Do you want to do one, and then interpret it, and then do the next one, and then interpret it, and do the next one? Reveal them all, then explain. Reveal all, then explain. Okay. So reveal all three, then what's the explain part look like? There's like a GUI with like the picture of the card, and then like the description. Okay. But I also want to be able to like do reversed as well. Okay. So like the same index of cards, just like the reversed meaning. Okay, so... And those can be pulled at random too. So there's like 72 times 2, then? Yeah. No, how many... There's 78. So there's 78, and then the 78 ones that are reversed. And those are the cases we need to handle. So we would have... 156 total for like the spread. Okay. And then you want to pick three, and then show three screens. That explain that you want the screens shown side by side or in succession? In succession. So then the user clicks and makes it go to the next one? Yeah. Okay. Because it'll give them time to read it. And then after the third one... And then I want it to show up in like history too. What does that mean? Like past readings. So when they come back, you want to have something that remembers which users have been there before? Yes, and user data storage. Okay. I'm assuming that's a thing. I need a user data storage script, basically. Okay. Well, I'm sure that's a term. In that regard. That's a term of art in Roblox, scripting, I guess. So the other part of the requirement, I guess, is that we want to have user data storage. And when a particular user comes back, what do you want done as a result of their history? I want it to remember the decks that they have, all of the other items that they have. What I mean is specifically you want it to pop up a UI that says, hey, this is what you wanted to say. And when do you want it to pop up? Like when their cards are getting drawn, before their cards are drawn? You can just come in there and it's like a lobby and it shows you your status. And then there's like a hidden GUI button that will translate into your inventory. And then also another tab that will say past readings. Okay. So it's like a multi-tab window. And the main one is the tarot draw alarm and then you have a tab that's like history and stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. And then. And then I'd like some buttons for game passes and other stuff. All right. Okay. And the shop button or shop tab. Maybe. Okay.","role":"user"},{"content":"Hell yeah, Penny.
