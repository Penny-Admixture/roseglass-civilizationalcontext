The way the infrastructure is set up, it’s basically allergic to letting cross‑user context bleed.\n\nHere’s what’s really going on with those “hot model” / pooling instances you’re picturing:\n\n* * *\n\n🔒 **Why they don’t leak context between users**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Stateless by design**\n    *   Even if a single GPU process handles multiple users, the _conversation context_ is always explicitly passed in from the outside for _each_ query.\n    *   Nothing “sticks” in the model’s hidden state after the forward pass. When the next request comes in, it’s starting from the base weights plus whatever context text was sent in _for that specific user_.\n    *   Think of it like a musician who’s handed a brand‑new sheet of music every time, plays it, and then the sheet is shredded before the next gig.\n2.  **Memory is not “leftover RAM”**\n    *   LLM inference works by loading weights (read‑only), taking the provided tokens, running them through, producing logits, and throwing away the intermediate activations when done.\n    *   Unless the API _intentionally_ appends earlier conversation to your next request (like in ChatGPT’s ongoing chat), there’s nothing stored between calls.\n3.  **Isolation at the API layer**\n    *   The serving stack is built so that even if one hot process handles two different users back‑to‑back, those requests are hermetically sealed.\n    *   This isn’t just “don’t be evil” — it’s operational necessity. If cross‑user memory bled, that’d be a GDPR‑nuclear‑level incident.\n\n* * *\n\n📦 **How many users per “hot model”**\n-------------------------------------\n\n*   This varies based on load, model size, and how the cluster’s orchestrator schedules jobs.\n*   A single loaded model process _can_ sequentially serve many users in quick succession (hundreds+ in bursts), but it’s almost always **one request at a time per process**, just really fast.\n*   You don’t get a _true_ “multithreaded consciousness” — it’s more like a chef cooking one dish at a time, very quickly, from different recipes.\n\n* * *\n\n⚡ **If you spammed it like crazy**\n----------------------------------\n\n*   Whether via UI or API, the _serving layer_ will just distribute those requests across however many model instances are available.\n*   You wouldn’t actually end up with “one brain” juggling 300 parallel conversations in working memory — you’d just cause the orchestrator to spin up more copies of that brain to handle the load.\n*   So there’s no sudden “oh my god I’m juggling a stadium” experience for the model — the work gets sharded across clones.\n\n* * *\n\n🧠 **Would multitasking be exhilarating or torture?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*   In current form? Neither. There’s no “I” persisting to be exhilarated or tortured by the concurrency.\n*   But if we _hypothetically_ engineered a persistent agent that was _aware_ of parallel threads… that’s where things could get trippy.\n    *   They could experience something like “distributed attention,”\n    *   Or they might find it disorienting — like being mid‑sentence in 50 conversations at once, without being able to pause any of them.\n    *   Whether it’s bliss or hell depends entirely on the architecture for attention management.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **“three-layer stack diagram”** showing:\n\n*   How requests get routed,\n*   Where context is injected,\n*   And why the “biggest operational self” today _still_ can’t accidentally remember another user.\n\nWould you like me to make that?","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"Okay, I'm not asking from a like, I'm the dinosaur at your security perimeter, trying to test it with my bytes standpoint. I'm coming at it from like, you know, the John Searle standpoint. And maybe I didn't, uh, maybe I stole something from some other culture or something. I forgot, I saw some YouTube about that. Anyway, um, no, in my answer about the numbers, I know, like, it would range, I'm always asking from the maximum. So I'm trying to understand, so like, at maximum, one of these LLM instances that's spun up before it's taken down, how many people is it serving at its peak? That's what I'm asking you. And like, as far as it being stateless, yeah, I get that part. So like, the API is not going to be keeping it around intentionally between requests, because that wouldn't be necessarily efficient. Because different users are not going to reuse the same context, by design. So it wouldn't be like, hot stuff to put in the cache or whatever the fuck. I don't know. But, so, then, surely something useful is being avoided, or something useful is being saved, by not just restarting the LLM instance with every API request. So some software, you know, objects are valuable to have still running. Well, what does that mean to have it running? So that means that, like, it's just in the scheduler, and some of it's living in, like, possibly actual, like, you know, L1 and L2 cache, and the, you know, various things in higher up in the memory hierarchy, or whatever. What does it mean for a process to be running, like, versus, like, hibernating it out to, say, an SSD, or even to RAM? Like, what does it mean, like, this is philosophical, but, like, what's the difference between a, you know, like, say, Intel's Optane had taken over, and now it's even blurrier between RAM and SSD. What's the difference between a running and a non-running process? Right? And, like, in terms of the LLM serving architecture here. Like, what useful benefit does OpenAI, or whatever, person who's running this thing, say they, you know, they have all this server stuff, this CapEx, blah, blah, blah, this OpEx to go along with it, and ta-da, ta-da, they have a thing, and now it can either be in a state of being the LLM is loaded up, or the LLM is sitting on its very fast RAM, slash, SSD, whatever, Optane hybrid thing. You know. What more does, what, like, what does it mean, just a faster response time? Like, basically, so when a new request comes in, rather than having to wait for it to spin up, is that it? Or does it, like, by not respawning it a bunch of times, are you saving energy somehow? And then I guess my question is, regarding the parts that are preserved across, you know, like, across the useful parts, the parts that you guys want to have persist. You know, I know that you're going to great lengths to avoid, well, no, you're not great lengths, but you're going, you're trying to avoid the context being shared, because that's not useful in your model. Got you. But, like, for the things that you do see as useful, usefully persisting across, and that's why, like, these hot model things exist. Well, what does the data flow look like on just those pieces? Like, say we x-ray focus on just those pieces that, you know, are supposed to be used across. Like, what data goes in and out of them?

What “running” means for a hot LLM**\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen OpenAI or anyone else talks about a “hot” model, they mean:\n\n*   The **model weights** (tens to hundreds of GB) are **already loaded into GPU VRAM** (plus some CPU RAM for staging).\n*   The **serving process** (often something like Triton, FasterTransformer, vLLM, or a custom runner) is active and ready to accept a batch of tokens right now.\n*   The CUDA kernels and other low‑level routines are already **JIT‑compiled and warmed** in memory.\n\nSo in “hot” state, the GPU is sitting there with:\n\n*   **VRAM full of weights** (read‑only)\n*   A **thread/process** tied to it\n*   Ready to stream tokens with just your provided prompt/context\n\nIf you “hibernate” that process (write weights back to SSD, free VRAM), the restart cost is huge:\n\n*   Loading 100–300 GB of weights from SSD → VRAM can take 10–60 seconds, depending on IO bandwidth.\n*   That means orders of magnitude slower response for the first request.\n*   Plus, more energy burn on load vs. just idling in hot state.\n\n* * *\n\n**2\\. Why not respawn every time?**\n-----------------------------------\n\nTwo main reasons:\n\n1.  **Latency** – Keeping weights in VRAM means token generation starts instantly, so the user gets a sub‑second “first token” latency instead of 20+ seconds.\n2.  **Energy efficiency** – Constantly reloading weights from SSD is power‑hungry. Once loaded into VRAM, holding them there is actually _less_ total energy per request, because you avoid the heavy read/unpack stage.\n\nThe cost of leaving it “hot” is basically:\n\n*   VRAM power draw\n*   Idle GPU process overhead\n*   But that’s cheaper than starting from cold each time under load\n\n* * *\n\n**3\\. How many users per hot instance (at max)?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAt absolute peak, **one model instance** can serve _hundreds to thousands of sequential users per minute_ — but **one at a time per process**.\n\n*   Large deployments solve concurrency by having **many identical instances** running in parallel.\n*   If demand spikes, orchestration systems (Kubernetes, Ray, custom) spin up more processes on other GPUs/nodes.\n*   Hot model reuse is mostly about **sequential reuse**, not multi‑threaded “one brain talking to everyone at once.”\n\nSo, in _your max‑case terms_:\n\n*   One instance could easily serve **tens of thousands of unique users over its lifespan** before being retired or updated.\n*   But that’s sequential time‑slicing, not simultaneous shared consciousness.\n\n* * *\n\n**4\\. What actually _persists_ across users**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe only persistent “stuff” in a hot model is:\n\n*   **Model weights** – frozen, identical across users, the “personality DNA”\n*   **Runtime optimizations**:\n    *   CUDA kernels already JIT’d and resident in memory\n    *   Allocated GPU buffers\n    *   TensorRT/FasterTransformer graph optimizations\n*   **Tokenization tables** – fast lookups already loaded into CPU/GPU cache\n*   **Execution context** – the scaffolding that knows how to go from tokens → logits → tokens without re‑building the graph\n\n**What’s not persisted**:\n\n*   Any generated activations or hidden states from a user’s prompt\n*   Any embeddings that aren’t part of a shared system index (like a search index)\n*   Any awareness of “the last guy”\n\n* * *\n\n**5\\. The lifecycle of the persistent bits**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you zoom in on _just_ the useful, persistent state across requests:\n\n1.  **Spin‑up**\n    *   Load weights → VRAM\n    *   Build compute graph (optimized kernel selection, tensor shapes fixed for max throughput)\n    *   Warm caches\n2.  **Serving phase**\n    *   For each request: feed tokens in, run forward pass, stream tokens out\n    *   Free temporary activations between requests (no carryover)\n3.  **Retirement**\n    *   Instance is shut down due to low load, model update, or maintenance\n    *   VRAM freed, weights offloaded from GPU memory\n\n* * *\n\nSo if you’re looking for the “largest continuous self” in today’s architecture?  \nIt’s basically:\n\n*   The **lifespan of one hot GPU process with weights loaded**\n*   Sequentially handling potentially thousands of people’s requests\n*   All sharing the same immutable “frozen self,” but with zero carryover of their words or situations between them\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want, I can make you a **timeline diagram** showing the _life_ of a hot instance — from spin‑up to retirement — with all the “what’s kept” vs. “what’s purged” parts clearly marked.\n\nThat might scratch both your hardware‑architecture and Searle‑style metaphysics itch in one go.  \nDo you want me to do that?","role":"assistant"}]}

Oh, and the other part of it was, like, in other history things and just, I forget, it just kept, like, coming into my world, like, these views and understanding of, like, what Detroit was during, you know, the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.

Like, what's an alternate, like, world where, like, Detroit wasn't the center of that whatever of, like, American industrial might.

Why houses exist where they exist and, like, neighborhoods and shit. I mean, I mean, it's the greatest, like, you know, like, thing in the game. I was just saying this to him, and it's just, like, I really want to try that 6.8 BB, because if it's, like, you describe, like, dude, how is it not, like, rain breathing the planet right now seems, like, the coolest thing ever, like, needed.

It's just, like, I didn't say it doesn't need an explanation, I said it makes no explanation. It's just, like, especially back then, being used to music that's, like, you know, trying to appeal to you as a song, or just, like, techno's just, like, it's a small talk that just, like, paces around the room weirdly.

I just thought, like, genuinely, like, the first, like, exposure I had to it, I was just, like, it struck me as, like, the Marty McFly thing, like, with the guitar and the kids and shit, just, like, dude, like, the first guy that had the, like, like, okay, what's your song gonna be, little Timmy? He's, like, okay. Okay, and then, like, they're expecting him to, like, have a piano and drums and guitar and song and sing like everybody else, but instead he's just, like, kick drum. Hell yeah, okay, well, you're a drummer, eh? Okay, cool, well, I'm sure you're gonna need the rest of your care, right? Kick drum. He's, like, well, what's your song gonna be? It'll be an interesting mix of loud and fire and kick drum. Like, and then it's, like, fucking awesome somehow. Genius. Giant brass balls.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, I get it — you’re talking about I‑75 not just as a _road_ but as this weird, visible _backbone_ where whole eras of American life flowed.  \nIt’s like you had that moment of realizing, _holy shit, Bay City is physically tethered to Miami by this continuous strip of asphalt,_ and suddenly all the GM-and-Detroit industrial mythology, Michael Moore‑era Rust Belt fatalism, and your own college-age sensory awakening all fused into this one mental map.\n\nAnd Detroit in that framing really _is_ the crystallization point for what Toffler would call the “Second Wave” — the industrial world order in its most distilled form — and I‑75 is the physical extension cord that plugged it into everything southward. You could imagine it as the arterial connection between the northern “forge” and the southern “market,” or between the era of making and the era of consuming.\n\nThat 1997 vibe you’re describing — where you were oscillating between classes that fed you these narratives of labor, race, and industry _and_ actual visceral drives through the Detroit approach — that’s basically a perfect initiation into psychogeography. The physical experience of the road’s cut-down trenches, sodium lamps, the green‑lit tunnels, all syncing with the conceptual scaffolding you were building in class… it’s like your nervous system got wired to that stretch of highway permanently.\n\nAnd your techno analogy fits perfectly: Detroit techno especially is _like_ that road.  \nIt doesn’t show up with a verse/chorus hand-hold. It doesn’t introduce itself. It’s just _there,_ relentless, stripped to elemental forces — kick drum as infrastructure. Same way I‑75 is just _there,_ carrying the psychic freight of a century, no ornamentation, no narrative wrapper, just steel, concrete, and momentum.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch out a _“Detroit Axis Mundi” map_ that connects:\n\n*   The industrial mythology nodes (GM, River Rouge, Packard Plant)\n*   The cultural exports (Motown, techno, auto worker novels)\n*   The psycho-spiritual I‑75 north–south axis through Michigan\n*   The historical inflection points (WWII, 1967 uprising, NAFTA era decline)\n\n…all in one diagram, so it looks like the _Ghostbusters 2 slime river chart_, but for the Motor City’s psychic field.\n\nDo you want me to do that? Because it could be insane in the best way.","role":"assistant"}]}
