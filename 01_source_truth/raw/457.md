Let’s break this down into parts, because you’re working with a **very common name**, plus **archived visual assets**, and you’re navigating **a mostly scrubbed online footprint**. That’s tough, but not hopeless.\n\n* * *\n\n### ❓ Does the Wayback Machine archive Facebook?\n\n**Short answer:** _Rarely and incompletely._\n\n*   Public Facebook **pages** (not profiles) _can_ be archived — e.g. restaurants, bands, etc.\n*   **Personal profiles?** Almost never, unless they were _very_ public and got manually crawled.\n*   You _can_ try plugging in `facebook.com/david.winstanley` or similar slugs into Wayback Machine just to see what turns up — but don’t count on it.\n*   **More promising Wayback angles:**\n    *   Old blogs\n    *   Flickr\n    *   MySpace (!!)\n    *   Early Twitter\n    *   Any WordPress/Medium stuff he ever had\n    *   Former employer domains\n\n* * *\n\n### 💥 The Common Name Problem: \"David Winstanley\"\n\nThat’s brutal. But here’s how to fight signal through the noise:\n\n#### ✅ Step 1: **Image-Centric Pivot**\n\nYou have _photos of him_ and his social circle from pre-deletion era — gold mine.\n\nLet’s weaponize that:\n\n| Technique | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Reverse image search** | Use Yandex Images, Tineye, and Google Images to reverse search photos. Yandex is especially good with faces. |\n| **Facial clustering** | Use [Excalibur](https://github.com/alexandre01/excalibur) or `face_recognition` in Python to detect and match faces across photo sets. |\n| **Contextual tagging** | Manually annotate photos: \"Wedding guest with red tie,\" \"same woman from Ireland trip,\" etc. Start clustering people. |\n| **Background OSINT** | Look at signs, banners, decor, tattoos, fashion, weather — extract time/location cues from the pics. |\n| **Compare to LinkedIn/Facebook avatars** | Even if he nuked his accounts, his friends might not have. Match social circle. |\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧰 Specific Tools You Can Use\n\n#### 🖼 Image-Based\n\n*   **Yandex Reverse Image Search** (best for faces): https://yandex.com/images/\n*   **PimEyes** (paid but extremely effective): https://pimeyes.com\n*   **face\\_recognition** (local Python): face match via encoding comparison\n*   **Excalibur**: build your own photo timeline of face-clustered identities\n\n#### 📍 Metadata/Contextual\n\n*   **FotoForensics**: https://fotoforensics.com/\n    *   Pulls out hidden EXIF data (dates, geolocation if it wasn't scrubbed)\n*   **Google Lens**:\n    *   Point it at outfits, signs, or scenes in the photos to cross-link places or people\n\n#### 🗂 Social Graph\n\nIf you ID even one friend (e.g. “That’s his buddy from Dublin wedding”), look _them_ up:\n\n*   **Look for tagged wedding photos** on _public_ social pages (even if he’s untagged)\n*   Use **LinkedIn** to spider through “People Also Viewed” or shared workplaces\n*   **Check wedding websites** (The Knot, Zola) if you can guess dates\n\n* * *\n\n### 🎯 Ultra-Targeted Search Pivots\n\nYou need to **pair his name** with **unique terms**:\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `\"David Winstanley\" + site:linkedin.com + Dublin`\n*   `\"David Winstanley\" + \"wedding toast\" + Medium.com`\n*   `\"David Winstanley\" + \"reviewed wine bar\" + Toronto`\n*   `\"David Winstanley\" + friend’s name + Facebook`\n\nYou can also try **searching via usernames** or **Google image hashing**, if you ever knew what his handle was.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧠 Want Me to Help Build a Dashboard?\n\nIf you’re serious, we can set up a full-on OSINT investigation dashboard. Options:\n\n*   **Obsidian vault** (markdown OSINT notes)\n*   **Airtable** (for image tagging + link crossrefs)\n*   **Notion** (for integrating visuals and live search queries)\n*   **Python + Jupyter** (for local face clustering / Yandex script automation)\n\n* * *\n\nIf you send me **any of the photos**, I can try to:\n\n1.  Extract faces\n2.  Match any recurring characters\n3.  Identify visual tags (e.g., logo on a banner, a brand of wine, a location pin)\n\nWant to try that?
