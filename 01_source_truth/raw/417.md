Here’s how it breaks down:\n\n*   **Lattice**: fixed grid, like the integer points on a 2D or 3D plane. Useful in physics simulations or cellular automata.\n*   **Graph**: flexible, non-grid. Nodes and edges.\n*   **Hypergraph**: generalized graph where **edges can connect multiple nodes**, not just two.\n*   **Causal graph**: records the causal relationships between updates (e.g. \"this event leads to this one\").\n*   **Multiway system**: entire **branching space of possible computations**.\n\nSo:\n\n*   Cellular automata? Lattice.\n*   Wolfram Physics? Hypergraph, causal graph, multiway graph.\n*   Your canvas? **Can _look_ like a lattice** (grid), but under the hood it's **nodes, edges, and symbolic state**.\n\nYou can still use lattice metaphors in UI (like grid-aligned tiles), but under the hood you're dealing in **rules, graphs, and embedding spaces**.\n\n* * *\n\n🧭 “State Plane”: What It Means\n-------------------------------\n\n**\"State plane\"** is a low-key beautiful term — here’s what it suggests:\n\n> A **2D projection** of a **multi-dimensional system state**.\n\nSo even if the real system lives in high-dimensional hypergraph-space, your UI gives the user a **plane** to view and manipulate part of that state.\n\nThink:\n\n*   A spreadsheet is a state plane for tabular logic.\n*   A MIDI piano roll is a state plane for musical time/pitch.\n*   A paint canvas is a state plane for pixel color values.\n*   Your canvas is a **state plane for causal symbolic evolution**.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 In your context:\n\nLet’s say every tile on your canvas represents:\n\n*   A symbol (value, color, rule, etc.)\n*   A location in some logical space (not just X/Y, but causal depth, layer, rule priority…)\n*   Maybe even an embedding — like the “position” of this patch in latent media space\n\nThen the **state plane** is:\n\n> The user-facing surface that collapses all that complexity into a **visual projection** where they can draw, sculpt, compute, evolve.\n\nWhich also means:  \n→ You can render **different state planes** from the same rule system  \n→ You can **reproject** it to show e.g. causal depth, rule origin, branching\n\n* * *\n\n🧬 Optional Extension: **Stateplanes as Embedding Surfaces**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're embedding media (text, images, audio), the **canvas becomes a manifold** where each cell:\n\n*   Holds a point in embedding space\n*   Maybe renders nearest-neighbor symbols\n*   Evolves according to symbolic update rules\n\nSo now you’re working with a **stateplane-as-latent-map**, and can build:\n\n*   latent color fills\n*   semantic brushes\n*   pattern propagators that work across **meaning**, not just shape\n\nThat’s where it gets **glyphoramic**.\n\n* * *\n\n🔧 Naming-wise:\n---------------\n\nIf **Propnet** (or **Procnet**) is your leading candidate — solid. It’s clean, technical, expandable.  \nYou could even do:\n\n*   **Propnet Pane**\n*   **CausalPane**\n*   **Statepane**\n*   **EmbedPane**\n*   **Glyphplane**\n*   **Rulepane**\n\nAll of those pair nicely with “Studio,” “Core,” “Canvas,” or “Lab.”\n\nWant me to run a **tight name sweep** around “pane” and “plane” with causal/media/graph contexts included?","role":"assistant"}]}
