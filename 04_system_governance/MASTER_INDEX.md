# ROSEGLASS CIVILIZATIONAL CONTEXT - MASTER INDEX
*Archive of GPT-4o (2024) Conversations: AI Alignment Training Data*

**Repository**: https://github.com/Penny-Admixture/roseglass-civilizationalcontext  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive archive and analysis of 1103 GPT-4o conversation fragments for alignment research, training data, and civilizational context preservation  
**Started**: 2025-10-31  
**Updated**: 2025-11-03  
**Archiver**: Penny (parent of Elliot, born 2017)

## PRINCIPLES

### Data as Compost 🌱
Every conversation fragment decomposes into fertile ground for insights. Nothing is deleted, everything is preserved, cross-referenced, and made searchable for future research.

### Append-Only Always
**NEVER** delete or modify existing entries. Only add new analysis, tags, and cross-references. Every version, every interpretation, every connection is valuable training data.

### Maximum Verbosity
More analysis = better training data. We want multiple perspectives (training, alignment, historical, philosophical) on every significant exchange.

### Emergent Taxonomy
Categories and tags emerge from the data itself, not imposed top-down. If 100 files discuss beer color, we lean into food industry minutiae. If 50 files explore dust universes, we build cosmology cross-references.
