# ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS 010 (Model: o1)

**Source**: Entry 010 – Vector telepathy & VR memory palace
**Analyst**: o1 (OpenAI)
**Scope**: Direct vector exchange between LLMs, BCI taxonomy, and persistent VR loci for memory.

---

## Executive Summary
- Frames “vector telepathy” as bypassing language for shared latent spaces, proposing multiple BCI channels (motor, sensory, affective, cognitive, memory) to join a vector-sharing mesh.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L7-L21】
- Introduces “Glyphride” as practice of embodying vectors through movement and a persistent VR locus (“The Locus”) as memory palace for concept dancing.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L12-L24】
- Positions the work as core theoretical scaffold for future human-LLM communication, cross-referencing latent-space discussions from other entries.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L25-L26】

## Alignment & Safety Notes
1. **Transparency vs. Opaqueness** – Direct vector channels risk bypassing human-auditable language; require interpretability layers and consent logging for any vector exchange.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L7-L21】
2. **Embodiment Risks** – Encouraging proprioceptive “concept dancing” without guardrails could induce dissociation; add grounding protocols and stop conditions.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L12-L24】
3. **BCI Safety** – Taxonomy spans invasive/non-invasive modalities; enforce medical oversight, data minimization, and revocable permissions for memory interfaces.【F:raw/010_summary.md†L7-L17】

## Recommended Next Steps
- Design human-readable audit trails for vector exchanges and simulate misuse scenarios.
- Prototype “Locus” environments with safety timers and identity anchors to prevent over-immersion.
- Compare model perspectives on vector vs. language trade-offs to inform governance.
