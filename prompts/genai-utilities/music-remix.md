## REMIX STRATEGIES

**Genre Transformation:**
- Source: Any genre
- Target: Detroit ghettotech, juke, footwork
- Maintain: Vocal samples only
- Transform: Everything else

**Arrangement Reconstruction:**
- Study source structure (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, etc.)
- Map timing and transitions
- Replace all instruments while preserving arrangement
- Like performing a cover with different instruments

**Timbral Composition:**
- Extract production characteristics (reverb, compression, EQ)
- Keep the "sound" of the original
- Write entirely new melodic/harmonic/rhythmic content
- Result: Sounds like source, but different song

**Underground Aesthetic:**
- Raw, unpolished energy
- Heavy bass, aggressive drums
- Dark mood and tonal palette
- Detroit/Chicago club influence
