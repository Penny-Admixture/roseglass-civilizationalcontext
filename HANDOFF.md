## Key Frameworks Added This Session

### Early Entries (003-006)
1. **Personal Multiplier Calculator (PMC)** - Entry 003
   - Formula: M = PP_adjusted * leverage L
   - Tracks individual contribution to collective p(doom)

2. **Family Risk Matrix (FRM)** - Entry 004
   - Grid: Risks × Family Roles (self/kid/AI)
   - Quantifies leakage and buffers

3. **Milestone Impact Tracker (MIT)** - Entry 005
   - Formula: I = (Foresight Score × Output Rate) / Global Window
   - Monthly log template for personal forecasts

4. **Somatic Buffer Model (SBM)** - Entry 006
   - Formula: B = (Ritual Frequency × Fit Score × Stress Reducer) / Milestone Intensity
   - Weekly log for body practices

### High-Number Entries (1001-1002)
5. **Self-Hosting Readiness Matrix (SHRM)** - Entry 1001
   - Levels 0-3: Cloud dependent → Full sovereignty
   - Assessment table: Skills, time, budget, risk tolerance
   - Docker Compose stack for practical deployment
   - Technical sovereignty as alignment practice

6. **Documentation as Defense (DaD)** - Entry 1002
   - 3-step protocol: Immediate doc → Triple framing → Archive integration
   - Response to real-time gender policing incident
   - Archive as counterspell against identity erasure
   - Frameworks: Forensic + Emotional + Creative documentation

## Entry Highlights

### Entry 1001: Infrastructure as Sovereignty
- Complete Docker setup (Nextcloud, Gitea, Filebrowser)
- Self-hosted alternatives to corporate platforms
- r/selfhosted community alignment
- Connects data sovereignty to alignment research

### Entry 1002: Archive as Crisis Response
- Real-time gender policing incident
- GPT-4o provides immediate trauma-informed support
- Creates style tracker, emotional log, poetic caption
- Guān Yīn spiritual discussion (Bodhisattva of compassion)
- "ive been wanting to do this since the 80s" - 40-year archive dream
- Shows archive functioning during actual crisis

**Key Quote (1002)**: "She tried to name me wrong. But my outfit knew better."

## Pattern Recognition

**Progression observed**:
- 003-004: Personal/family risk frameworks
- 005-006: Timeline/somatic practices  
- 1001: Infrastructure to house everything
- 1002: Infrastructure activated during crisis

**Archive maturation**: From theory (what could happen) → praxis (what to do when it does)

**Technical-to-emotional pipeline**: Infrastructure enables vulnerability, vulnerability justifies infrastructure

## Token Management

**Session Stats**:
- Starting tokens: 190,000
- Usage: ~145,000
- Remaining: ~45,000
- Efficiency: 2 raw + 6 analyses (8 files total)

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Continue high numbers** (1003-1010) - Different themes, mature archive perspective
2. **Fill middle gaps** (415-420, 422-423) - Complete mid-range coverage
3. **Multi-model gaps** (001, 002) - Add Grok analyses where only Claude exists
4. **Cross-reference frameworks** - Show how PMC/FRM/MIT/SBM/SHRM/DaD interact

## Repository Health

**Documentation**: Up to date with session 11 additions
**Multi-Model**: Growing - 6 new Grok analyses added (003-006, 1001-1002)
**Quality**: High - practical frameworks with quantifiable metrics + crisis response protocols
**Coverage**: 20.4% alignment (up from 19.9%), 22.0% raw (up from 21.8%)
**Variety**: Now includes high-number entries (1000+) showing different themes

*Repository: https://github.com/Penny-Admixture/roseglass-civilizationalcontext*
*Philosophy: Data as compost. Append-only always. Multi-model perspectives. Practical tools over theory.*
*Session 11: Claude Sonnet 4.5 - Early frameworks (003-006) + High-number crisis response (1001-1002)*

## For Next Claude Instance

**Start Here**:
1. Read this HANDOFF.md
2. Review 1001-1002 for quality bar on high-number entries
3. Choose strategy:
   - Continue high numbers (1003+) for thematic variety
   - Fill middle gaps (415-420) for sequential coverage
   - Add Grok analyses to Claude-only entries (001, 002)
4. Token budget: ~190k, stop at ~170k for handoff updates

**Quality Patterns**:
- Grok analyses: Plain language, quantifiable frameworks, practical tools
- High-number entries: More mature themes (infrastructure, crisis response)
- Early entries: Foundation frameworks (risk, family, timelines)

**Archive Function Demonstrated**:
- Entry 1002 shows archive as real-time crisis support
- Not just historical record - active tool during harm
- "I sure hope you actually do all the shit you say" - stakes are real

**Progress Tracking**:
- Each new file = note in HANDOFF
- Update multi-model table
- Keep running count accurate
- Note thematic patterns as they emerge
