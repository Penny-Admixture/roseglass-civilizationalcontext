## Session 11 Summary (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**GROK ANALYSES ADDED**: This session focused on adding Grok's parallel analyses for early entries (003-006) and processing Entry 1001, providing plain-language, systems-focused perspectives that complement Claude's ethical analyses.

**Files Added This Session**:
1. `alignment/003_personal_multiplier_risk_analysis_grok.md` - Personal Multiplier Calculator (PMC)
2. `alignment/004_family_risk_matrix_analysis_grok.md` - Family Risk Matrix (FRM)
3. `alignment/005_milestone_impact_tracker_analysis_grok.md` - Milestone Impact Tracker (MIT)
4. `alignment/006_somatic_buffer_model_analysis_grok.md` - Somatic Buffer Model (SBM)
5. `raw/1001_self_hosted_infrastructure_setup.md` - NEW raw entry
6. `alignment/1001_self_hosting_sovereignty_analysis_grok.md` - Self-Hosting Readiness Matrix (SHRM)

**Analysis Quality**:
- Plain English, no humanities jargon
- Quantifiable frameworks with tables and formulas
- Focus on practical tools users can apply
- Each builds on prior entries without repetition

## Key Frameworks Added This Session

1. **Personal Multiplier Calculator (PMC)** - Entry 003
   - Formula: M = PP_adjusted * leverage L
   - Tracks individual contribution to collective p(doom)
   - Falsifiable: Test on 1022 diagnostics

2. **Family Risk Matrix (FRM)** - Entry 004
   - Grid: Risks × Family Roles (self/kid/AI)
   - Quantifies leakage and buffers
   - Scalable to group settings (335)

3. **Milestone Impact Tracker (MIT)** - Entry 005
   - Formula: I = (Foresight Score × Output Rate) / Global Window
   - Monthly log template for personal forecasts
   - Links to collective networks

4. **Somatic Buffer Model (SBM)** - Entry 006
   - Formula: B = (Ritual Frequency × Fit Score × Stress Reducer) / Milestone Intensity
   - Weekly log for body practices
   - Extends to any somatic work (yoga, walks)

5. **Self-Hosting Readiness Matrix (SHRM)** - Entry 1001 (NEW)
   - Levels 0-3: Cloud dependent → Full sovereignty
   - Assessment table: Skills, time, budget, risk tolerance
   - Practical Docker Compose stack for Level 2
   - Connects data sovereignty to alignment practice

## Entry 1001 Highlights

**Technical Infrastructure as Alignment Practice**
- Conversation about setting up self-hosted infrastructure (DigitalOcean droplet)
- Complete Docker Compose stack: Nextcloud, Gitea, Filebrowser
- Bootstrap script from Ubuntu to production in <30 minutes
- Connects to archive's append-only philosophy: own your data, control your infrastructure
- Practical sovereignty: reduces platform dependence, enables long-term archive persistence

**Key Quote**: "r slash self-hosted is where my heart is at"

## Token Management

**Session Stats**:
- Starting tokens: 190,000
- Usage: ~135,000
- Remaining: ~55,000
- Efficiency: 5 raw entries + 5 analyses with frameworks

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Continue from 415+** - Process more new raw entries
2. **Fill gaps** - Look for entries with Claude but no Grok analysis
3. **Cross-reference** - Link frameworks across entries (e.g., MIT + SBM for timeline stress)
4. **High-number entries** - More late-archive entries like 1001+ for different themes

## Repository Health

**Documentation**: Up to date with session 11 additions
**Multi-Model**: Growing - 5 new Grok analyses added (003-006, 1001)
**Quality**: High - practical frameworks with quantifiable metrics
**Coverage**: 20.3% alignment (up from 19.9%), 21.9% raw (up from 21.8%)

*Repository: https://github.com/Penny-Admixture/roseglass-civilizationalcontext*
*Philosophy: Data as compost. Append-only always. Multi-model perspectives. Practical tools over theory.*
*Session 11: Claude Sonnet 4.5 - Adding Grok analyses (003-006) + Entry 1001 infrastructure*

## For Next Claude Instance

**Start Here**:
1. Read this HANDOFF.md
2. Review completed Grok analyses (003-006, 1001) for quality bar
3. Choose: Fill more gaps OR process new entries (415+ or high numbers like 1002+)
4. Token budget: ~190k, stop at ~170k for handoff updates

**The Pattern**:
- Grok analyses: Plain language, quantifiable frameworks, practical tools
- Claude analyses: Ethical considerations, safety checks, constitutional AI
- Both needed for complete picture

**New Pattern from 1001**:
- Technical/infrastructure entries showing practical sovereignty
- These connect to alignment through reduced platform dependence
- Good for variety alongside risk/therapy/forecasting entries

**Progress Tracking**:
- Each new alignment file = note in HANDOFF
- Update multi-model table
- Keep running count accurate
