## PENNYFIED KNOCKOFFS OF EXISTING TITLES

### Tank Tank Tank (Wii knockoff)
- Source: Tank Tank Tank, Namco Bandai, Wii/arcade
- Concept: Penny-bent version — needs theming pass, likely estrogen-fueled chaos edition
- Notes: TBD

### Wizards and Warriors (NES knockoff)
- Source: Wizards & Warriors, Rare, NES (1987)
- Concept: Penny-bent version — TBD theming
- Notes: TBD

### Paperboy (NES knockoff)

### Hammer Jump Stack Game (mobile knockoff)
- Source: That weird mobile game where you use a hammer to do trick jumps all the way up a vertiginous pile of random objects — it slowly becomes above-the-atmosphere and transitions into Super Mario Galaxy-style physics
- Concept: Penny-bent version of that exact experience
- Notes: The above-atmosphere / gravity flip transition is the core appeal to preserve

## ORIGINAL TITLES

### BASS TOWER
**Concept**

A hard sci-fi / historical engineering game about operating a medieval clocktower-scale mechanical musical apparatus, designed like a carillon but for bass.

**Setting / World**

1376 Europe. A castle tower housing a massive mechanical sound machine. The apparatus is powered by heavy bags tied to ropes — NPCs called "helpers" use long ropes to get the leverage to hoist heavy bags, continuously resetting the mechanical energy reservoir that powers the whole instrument.

**The Instrument**

The goal of the in-universe device: produce the full frequency spectrum from sub-bass all the way up to hi-hat-like sounds, using only mechanical means available in 1376 Europe. Anything is fair game as long as it was historically plausible:
- Plucked strings (various scales)
- Plucked rigid cajon-box type structures (but huge — room-scale)
- Large membranes of any type
- Bell-adjacent percussion
- Any other resonant mechanical structure available pre-1400

The hard sci-fi constraint: actually reason through what physics and engineering would be required to scale a music-box-like device up to where it can produce meaningful sub-bass via purely mechanical means. What surface area, what tension, what mass, what resonance chamber size? The game should get this right or at least plausibly gesture at it.

**Gameplay**

You play as the carillon operator. Your job is to:
1. Orchestrate the "helpers" and their rope/bag operations
2. Chain and cascade the heavy bag mechanisms to perform logic sequences
3. Make the notes fire at the right times to produce a particular tune

The UI is intentionally like a very peculiar bad DAW — you're operating a massive cascading logic machine made of rope, counterweights, and levers to sequence musical events. Rockstar-mechanic feel: you try to follow along / hit your marks as the tune plays out, or you compose and then execute.

**Design Philosophy**
- The mechanical complexity IS the game — it should feel like operating something genuinely alien and physical
- Hard sci-fi commitment to the engineering: no magic, just scaled-up medieval physics
- The "bad UI DAW" quality is a feature: figuring out how to get the machine to do what you want is the puzzle
- Possible comparison points: Opus Magnum (alchemy machine logic puzzles), Baba Is You (systems thinking), but grounded in physical simulation

**Open Questions**
- Is it a puzzle game (fixed tunes to reproduce) or a creative tool (compose your own)?
- How much physics simulation vs abstracted mechanics?
- Multiplayer? Multiple operators needed for complex pieces?
- What's the narrative frame — are you building the tower, inheriting it, restoring it?
