# HORMONE HORIZON — Level Design Ideas
**Filed**: 2026-02-21  
**Status**: Brainstorm / pre-production  
**Note**: Append-only. Add ideas below, never delete.

## SECRET / WARP WORLD MECHANICS

### Minus World / Hidden Pipe System (SMB1 Style)
- Hidden invisible block in standard level (equivalent of SMB1 4-2)
- That block leads to another hidden invisible block
- Which leads to a block that springs a vine
- Vine goes from underground area straight up to a weird cloud coin heaven
- Cloud heaven has a warp zone at the end
- Full "level magic" vibes — totally undocumented, discovered by accident or word of mouth

## SEASONAL / HOLIDAY LEVELS

| Level | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Christmas** | Snow, lights, Santa enemies, gift box powerups |
| **Summer Beach / Swimsuit** | Waves, parasols, sunscreen powerup, beach volleyball enemy |
| **St. Patrick's Day** | Green everything, shamrock coins, rainbow (literal) at end |
| **Valentine's Day** | Heart projectiles, pink/red palette, love letter bombs |
| **Back to School** | Notebook paper BG, pencil enemies, hall pass as item |
| **Fourth of July Party Weekend** | Fireworks as hazards AND powerups, red/white/blue, BBQ enemies |
| **Halloween** | Dark, jack-o-lanterns, ghost enemies, candy powerups |
| **Birthday** | Confetti parallax, cake boss, candle projectiles, balloon physics |
| **Waterpark / Waterslide** | Slide physics section, wave pool room, inner tube shield |

## PHYSICS / SCIENCE INSPIRED LEVELS

| Level | Core Mechanic Concept |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Relativistic Physics** | Speed affects time dilation — move fast and the level slows around you, move slow and enemies catch up; length contraction on sprites at high velocity |
| **Quantum Logic** | Enemies exist in superposition until observed (looked at directly); some doors only open if you DON'T look at them; Schrödinger powerup box |
| **Everettian Multiverse** | Parallel ghost-you in adjacent screen lane making different choices; occasionally branches merge or diverge; death in one branch visible as ghost |
| **David Bohm Pilot Wave** | Invisible "guide wave" nudges you — feel a pull toward certain paths; enemies follow wave patterns not direct pursuit; the wave is visible only with a special powerup |
| **Planck Length Is Bigger** | Reality visibly pixelates at small scales; minimum position granularity enforced — movement is chunky/quantized; some enemies exploit the grid |
| **Speed of Light Is Slower** | ~30 mph. Visible light-cone. You can outrun your own projectiles. Doppler shift on audio. Light from explosions arrives late. Causality gets weird. |

## AESTHETIC / VIBE LEVELS

| Level | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| **Underwater** | Buoyancy physics, bubbles, bioluminescent palette, kelp parallax, pressure mechanic at depth |
| **Cloud Crystal Castle Kawaii** | Pastel, floating platforms, crystal SFX, shoujo manga panel transitions, soft enemies |
| **Candy Rave** | Strobing candy colors, 4/4 kick drum synced hazards, gummy bear enemies, lollipop weapons |
| **Gritty Detroit Rave** | Dark, industrial, warehouse textures, techno BPM-synced enemies, fog machine (actual fog overlay) |
| **NYC Level** | Subway section + rooftop section + yellow cab hazards + bodega cat ally |

## ARTIST-INSPIRED LEVELS (UNOFFICIAL / UNLICENSED VIBES ONLY)

| Level | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Unofficially Aphex Twin Themed** | Glitchy corruption aesthetic, face-in-spectrogram hidden image, drill n bass BPM enemy waves, RDJ-face easter egg somewhere |
| **DJ Assault — Ass & Titties** *(mature audiences)* | Detroit electro, maximalist, unhinged, exactly what it sounds like, content warning screen before entry |

---

## ALTERED STATES LEVELS

| Level | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Salvia** | Reality folds, gravity rotates mid-level, you are briefly the level, extremely short (salvia accurate), dissociative enemy types that ARE you |
| **Acid** | Long. Everything breathes. Colors shift continuously. Time perception mechanic — subjective duration vs real duration. Fractal zoom sections. Music reactive. |

---

## NOTES / FUTURE ADDITIONS

- All secret levels should be completely undocumented in any official material
- Seasonal levels could be time-gated (real system clock) OR unlockable
- Physics levels should teach the actual concept through mechanic, not just aesthetic
- The altered states levels need content warnings and should be unlockable only
- Consider: a "Roseglass Archive" meta-level where the corpus itself is the environment
