# Repository Architecture

This repository now follows a 10/3/1 epistemic weighting layout:

- `01_source_truth/`: Ground Truth artifacts (Weight 10.0)
- `02_primary_analysis/`: Primary analysis and derivations (Weight 3.0)
- `03_meta_council/`: Meta-commentary and cross-model perspectives (Weight 1.0)
- `04_system_governance/`: System rules, coverage, and tracking (Weight N/A)
- `99_archive_ops/`: Operational history, prompts, templates, and supporting artifacts

Each top-level folder groups materials by their epistemic weight to clarify sourcing and downstream interpretation.
